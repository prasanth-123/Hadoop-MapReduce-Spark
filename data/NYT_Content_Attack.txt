In a manifesto posted online before his attack, the gunman who killed 50 last month in a rampage at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, said he drew inspiration from white extremist terrorism attacks in Norway, the United States, Italy, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
His references to those attacks placed him in an informal global network of white extremists whose violent attacks are occurring with greater frequency in the West.
An analysis by The New York Times of recent terrorism attacks found that at least a third of white extremist killers since 2011 were inspired by others who perpetrated similar attacks, professed a reverence for them or showed an interest in their tactics.
The connections between the killers span continents and highlight how the internet and social media have facilitated the spread of white extremist ideology and violence.
In one instance, a school shooter in New Mexico corresponded with a gunman who attacked a mall in Munich. Altogether, they killed 11 people.

One object of fascination for the Christchurch killer and at least four other white extremists was Anders Behring Breivik, the far-right extremist who killed 77 in a bombing and mass shooting in Norway in 2011.
Mr. Breivik’s lengthy manifesto offered a litany of grievances about immigration and Islam — and the attacks became a model for future ones.
“I think that Breivik was a turning point, because he was sort of a proof of concept as to how much an individual actor could accomplish,” said J.M. Berger, author of the book “Extremism” and a research fellow with VOX-Pol, a European academic initiative to study online extremism.
“He killed so many people at one time operating by himself, it really set a new bar for what one person can do.”
Shortly after the Norway massacre, a prominent American white supremacist named Frazier Glenn Miller wrote on a white supremacist forum that Mr. Breivik had “inspired young Aryan men to action.” Mr. Miller opened fire on a Jewish retirement home and community center in Kansas a few years later, killing three.
Mr. Breivik was not the only mass killer to inspire copycats. The Christchurch shooter also paid tribute to a Canadian man who opened fire inside a Quebec City mosque in 2017, writing his name on one of the guns used in his attack.
That Canadian gunman read extensively about Dylann Roof, the American who killed nine worshipers at a black church in South Carolina in 2015.
At least four white extremist killers made statements online praising Elliot Rodger, a racist and misogynist who targeted women in a 2014 spree, before carrying out their own attacks.
All these attacks occurred amid a surge of white supremacist and xenophobic terrorism in the West that has frequently targeted Muslims, immigrants and other minority groups, the Times analysis found.

The analysis was based on data from the Global Terrorism Database and identified nearly 350 white extremist terrorism attacks in Europe, North America and Australia from 2011 through 2017, the latest year of available data. We also examined preliminary data on attacks in the United States in 2018.
The database is a project of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism at the University of Maryland. It relies on news reports and other records to capture episodes that meet its definition of terrorism: the use of violence by a non-state actor to attain a political or social goal.
Over this period, white extremism — an umbrella term encompassing white nationalist, white supremacist, neo-Nazi, xenophobic, anti-Muslim and anti-Semitic ideologies — accounted for about 8 percent of all attacks in these regions and about a third of those in the United States.
Erin Miller, who manages the database, said the increase in white extremist terrorism parallels a rise in hate crimes and bias episodes in the West and that deadly attacks are occurring more often.
“There’s a common framing of far-right terrorism or domestic terrorism as being ‘terrorism lite’ and not as serious,” she said. “It’s an interesting question given that far-right attacks can be quite devastating.”
In recent years, Europe has seen a surge in far-right and xenophobic violence amid an influx of migrants and refugees from conflicts in the Middle East and Africa.

‘Lone Wolf Crusader’ Ignites a Trend Mr. Breivik killed 77 people in the 2011 Norway attacks and set a new bar for white extremist violence, inspiring a number of imitators.
Retaliation Attacks Retribution was suspected to be a motivating factor in at least 19 attacks. White extremists responded by attacking mosques after two Muslim men killed a British soldier in 2013. Similar retaliations took place after terrorism attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper by Islamic extremists, and a wave of attacks in Paris in November 2015.
Targeting MuslimsAbout a quarter of white extremist attacks in Europe targeted Muslims and mosques. These attacks increased significantly starting in 2015 along with a wave of xenophobic violence reacting to the migrant crisis.
Attacks on mosques, Islamic institutions and Muslim individuals
2011-14
2015-17
Anti-Migrant Attacks SpikeXenophobia was behind the spike in attacks Europe saw in 2015. At least 86 attacks that year specifically targeted refugee shelters and migrants, and dozens more followed in 2016 and 2017.
2016 Munich AttackThe deadliest of these was a shooting at a Munich mall in 2016. The teenage gunman studied school shooters, admired Adolf Hitler and wrote a manifesto railing against “foreign infiltration.” The police said he most likely planned his rampage for the fifth anniversary of the Norway attacks.
In North America, the ideologies of older white supremacist groups like the Ku Klux Klan have mixed with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim sentiment and the fresh-faced fascism of the “alt right” to give rise to a more lethal terror.

Attacks on Places of Worship There were at least 38 attacks that targeted places of worship, like churches, synagogues and mosques across North America.
Mosques and other Islamic institutions
Other places of worship
Until last year, the deadliest of these attacks in the United States were a shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012 and a shooting at a black church in South Carolina in 2015.
Online RadicalizationAn attacker who voiced his hatred of women and people of color in a manifesto before killing six people in California in 2014 signaled a new type of terrorist. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups, called the attacker the “first alt-right killer.” Several more attackers who fit this profile killed over the next few years.
Rising ViolenceThen in 2017, attacks jumped in a tense post-election political environment. Nine of these proved deadly.
Deadly attacks
Other attacks in 2017
Preliminary 2018 data for the United States shows five additional deadly white extremist attacks, including mass shootings at high schools in Florida and Texas and at a Pittsburgh synagogue.

Mail bombing attempts
Other attacks in 2018
There were five white extremist attacks in Australia from 2011 through 2017, all of which were attacks on mosques and Islamic centers. There were no such attacks in New Zealand during that same period.
Then the massacre of worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15 — the deadliest shooting in modern New Zealand history — helped put the global nature of white extremism into relief. The shooter was an Australian man who said he was radicalized during his travels in Europe and designed his attack to draw an American audience.
Experts say the same broad motives are at play whether the target is a mosque in Perth or an asylum seekers’ shelter in Dresden or a synagogue in Pittsburgh. Attackers who identify as white, Christian and culturally European see an attack on their privileged position in the West by immigrants, Muslims and other religious and racial minorities.
The difference now is that it is easier than ever for extremists to connect both domestically and across continents, according to Mr. Berger, the “Extremism” author. The entry point for radicalization is less narrow than it was during earlier waves of white supremacist action, when finding ideological fellow travelers typically required meeting in person.
“This is a particularly strong wave,” Mr. Berger said, “and I think it’s being fueled by a lot of political developments and also by the sort of connective tissue that you get from the Internet that wasn’t there before that’s really making it easier for groups to be influenced and to coordinate, or not necessarily coordinate but synchronize over large geographical distances.”
Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project, said that given these international connections, it’s important to reconsider the nature of the threat. “We conceive of this problem as being a domestic one,” she said. “But that’s not the case.”
The challenge for law enforcement will be to buck a sometimes myopic focus on Islamic extremism as the only driver of international terrorism.
It may also require rethinking the legal framework for what constitutes terrorism: from violence that arises from a command and control structure to a looser definition that can account for a wider range of violent actors who share a common ideology.
“They don't see themselves as Americans or Canadians, very much like the Christchurch killer didn’t see himself as an Australian; he saw himself as part of a white collective,”  Dr. Beirich said.
“It has never been the case that these people didn’t think in a global way. They may have acted in ways that looked domestic but the thinking was always about building an international white movement.”
This analysis was based on data from the Global Terrorism Database for the years 2011 through 2017 and preliminary data for the United States for 2018. To identify episodes involving white extremists, we looked at the available data on perpetrators; their affiliations with terrorist groups; stated motives and targets; and conducted independent research.
We examined attacks perpetrated by anti-immigrant extremists, anti-Muslim extremists, neo-Nazi extremists, right-wing extremists, anti-Semitic extremists, neo-fascists, white extremists, anti-Arab extremists, the Ku Klux Klan, anti-Sikh extremists and incel extremists. We also examined attacks on migrants and refugees, places of worship and religious figures, and attacks on black people, Hispanic people and Hindus.
For episodes in which the identity of the perpetrator was unknown, we made a determination about ideology based on the target or through further research. We excluded episodes with insufficient evidence of ideological motivation.
We excluded cases that might otherwise have met our criteria — for example, an attack on a mosque — if they took place as part of an active conflict, like in a war zone.
We excluded the small number of instances of right-wing and anti-government political violence in which the perpetrators did not appear to be motivated by white extremist ideology.
Global Terrorism Database researchers mark certain cases as in doubt as to whether they constitute terrorism, but since they were ultimately included in the database, they were included in our analysis when they met our criteria.
Attacks by the same perpetrator that occurred on the same day were counted separately. Location information was not available for two attacks in Europe. These are not shown on the maps but are included in the analysis. The chart showing connections among attackers only includes attacks in the United States and Canada for 2018.

BEIJING — A man wielding a knife killed two students and injured two others at an elementary school in central China on Wednesday, according to the local authorities.
The attack occurred early Wednesday morning at Baijiaping Township Wanquan Elementary School in Ningyuan County, Hunan Province. A brief statement issued by Ningyuan County on its official WeChat social media account said that the two injured students had been taken to a hospital. Reached by telephone, an official surnamed Feng at the public security bureau of Ningyuan County said the injured students were in stable condition but declined to offer more details.
The statement said that the suspect, a 31-year-old man surnamed Zheng, had been taken into police custody. Officials offered no details on the motivation behind the attack. The incident is still under investigation.
Videos circulating online showed a large crowd of anxious adults carrying umbrellas gathered outside the school gates.
Gun violence is rare in China, where ownership of firearms is strictly regulated. But Wednesday’s violence was the latest in a string of knife attacks on Chinese schools in recent years, adding to persistent concerns among parents about school safety.
In the last year, knife attacks have occurred at schools in Shaanxi Province, in Shanghai and in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. In January, a man attacked and injured 20 children with a hammer at an elementary school in Beijing.
This week, the police in Henan Province said they had detained a kindergarten teacher on suspicion of poisoning 23 children.
The frequency of school attacks has shown few signs of abating despite the fact that perpetrators of such crimes in China are often dealt severe punishment, including the death penalty.
Experts have said the spate of school attacks can be attributed in part to a lack of high-quality mental health care in China and growing frustrations about social inequality and injustice. Some have pointed to a series of deadly stabbings of children in 2010 as the inspiration for later copycat attacks.
Some users on Sina Weibo, a Chinese social media platform similar to Twitter, reacted to the news of the attack in Hunan on Wednesday by calling for the death penalty for the attacker. Others expressed disappointment that after so many years, the problem of school attacks had not yet been resolved.
“When I was in elementary school, there were many attacks like this,” one user said. “Schools organized drills and hired many security guards with anti-riot gear to guard the gates.”
“It’s hard to believe that now I’m about to graduate from college and humans are still doing the same thing, even though the era has changed,” the user added.

SRINAGAR — India's northern state of Jammu and Kashmir is to restrict civilian traffic on a main state highway for two days a week in a bid to ward off militant attacks on security convoys as a general election nears, state authorities said on Wednesday.
On Feb. 14, 40 Indian security personnel were killed when a suicide bomber from a Pakistan-based militant group attacked a security convoy at Pulwama in Indian-controlled Kashmir.
The attack has heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, each of which sent warplanes to attack the other's territory after the attack.
Civilian traffic will be banned from 4 a.m. to 5 p.m on Sunday and Wednesday each week until May 31 to allow for exclusive movement of security convoys.
India's staggered election begins on April 11 and ends on May 19.
The prohibition will apply between Baramulla region and Udhampur, covering most of the 350-km (217-mile) Srinagar-Jammu highway, which passes through the state's major towns.
The highway is the main artery connecting disputed Kashmir to the rest of India.
The decision was taken "keeping in view the large movement of security forces on the national highway during the parliamentary elections and associated possibility of any fidayeen terror attack on security forces’ convoys", the statement said.
Fidayeen is a term used to describe Islamist militants engaged in suicide missions.

JERUSALEM — An Israeli shot and killed a Palestinian who he said tried to attack him with a knife near the West Bank city of Nablus.
A Nablus hospital says another Palestinian was moderately wounded in Wednesday's shooting.
The Israeli military says an Israeli civilian shot a Palestinian who attempted to carry out a stabbing. Israel's Beilinson hospital says the Palestinian later died of his wounds.
The Israeli man told local media the Palestinian "jumped on the car with a knife and tried to open the door."
Since 2015, Palestinians have killed over 50 Israelis in West Bank stabbings, shootings and car-ramming attacks. Israeli forces have killed over 260 Palestinians in that same period. Israel says most were attackers, but clashes between protesters and soldiers have also turned deadly.

FRANKFURT — German drugmaker Bayer has contained a cyber attack it believes was hatched in China, the company said, highlighting the risk of data theft and disruption faced by big business.
Bayer found the infectious software on its computer networks early last year, covertly monitored and analyzed it until the end of last month and then cleared the threat from its systems, the company said on Thursday. 
"There is no evidence of data theft," Bayer said in a statement, though a spokesman added that the overall damage was still being assessed and that German state prosecutors had launched an investigation.
"This type of attack points toward the 'Wicked Panda' group in China, according to security experts," the spokesman added, citing DCSO, a cyber security group set up by Bayer in 2015 with German partners Allianz, BASF and Volkswagen.
Third-party personal data was also not compromised, the spokesman said.
The hackers used malware called WINNTI, which makes it possible to access a system remotely and then pursue further exploits from there, said Andreas Rohr of the DCSO.
"Once it has been installed, more or less any action can be carried out," Rohr said.
Discovery of WINNTI provides clear evidence of complex and sophisticated malware that is used in a targeted, sustained espionage campaign, he added
Bayer, Germany's biggest drugmaker and the world's largest agricultural supplies company after its takeover of Monsanto, said it could not determine exactly when its systems were first compromised.
'ACTIVE GROUP'
There was a WINNTI attack on computer systems at German technology group ThyssenKrupp in 2016, according to media reports at the time.
Rohr declined to comment in detail on the Bayer case, citing a non-disclosure agreement, but said he knew of at least five WINNTI attacks in Germany. 
"This is a very active group of hackers with the ability to carry multiple international attacks in parallel," he said.
Manufacturing groups across the globe are expanding their data networks as sensors, processing chips and analytical tools become more advanced and cheaper. 
Germany has experienced a big increase in the number of security incidents hitting critical infrastructure such as power grids, the country's cybersecurity agency said in February.
While it's not possible to say with certainty who was responsible for the attack, because the malware used is widely available, Rohr said the methods bore the hallmarks of Chinese hackers.
"The malware most probably comes from a Chinese group of ‘mercenaries’ who carry out targeted attacks and campaigns on the internet for money," he said.
"Their targets have in the past been the online gambling industry, the theft of intellectual property of the affected companies or the use of access for the purposes of espionage.”
German broadcasters BR and NDR initially reported the incident.

BEIRUT — A blast in Syria's Raqqa on Wednesday that wounded people was caused by an unexploded mine left by Islamic State going off, not by suicide attacks, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said.
The head of the SDF's media office Mustafa Bali told journalists in an online message that earlier information it provided about suicide bombings in the city, captured from IS in 2017, was wrong.

YPSILANTI, Mich. — Police at Eastern Michigan University have issued a warning: "Beware of goose!"
The department says potentially aggressive geese have been spotted on campus and issued the warning when posting a video on Instagram showing one goose attacking and chasing a person in a school parking lot.
Police say the attack happened on the north end of the school's campus in Ypsilanti. Two geese are nesting in the area, and the birds are protective.
University spokesman Geoff Larcom says it's not unusual for geese to nest on campus this time of year. He says several students have reported goose attacks, but no injuries have been reported.
Larcom tells MLive.com: "A few students have tried to take selfies of the geese when they are hissing, but we advise against that."

PRAGUE — Czech police say they have extradited to Austria two suspects who allegedly formed a terror cell with a man detained by Austrian authorities over unsuccessful attacks on trains in Germany.
They said Wednesday that the two Iraqi citizens, a 30-year-old man and a 27-year-old woman, were escorted to the Austrian border Tuesday and handed over to Austrian officers. They pleaded not guilty but agreed to be extradited.
They were arrested at Austria's request last week at after arriving at Prague's international airport.
The first suspect, a 42-year-old Iraqi, was arrested in Vienna on March 25. He's suspected of carrying out two attacks late last year, including one in which a high-speed train hit a steel cable stretched over tracks between Nuremberg and Munich. Nobody was hurt.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said on Sunday that a break-in and robbery at its embassy in Spain last month was “a grave terrorist attack” and a “flagrant violation of international law,” calling on Madrid to conduct a thorough and fair investigation of the mysterious incident.
North Korea was also closely monitoring reports that the F.B.I. and an anti-North Korea group had been involved, a spokesman for its Foreign Ministry told the official Korean Central News Agency.
The unidentified spokesman’s comments were the first official North Korean reaction to the Feb. 22 raid.
“This kind of act should never be tolerated over the globe,” he said, adding that during the assault on the embassy, an armed group had “bound, beaten and tortured” staff members and stolen communications equipment.
North Korea expects the Spanish authorities to “bring the terrorists and their wire pullers to justice in conformity with the relevant international law,” he said.
The raid at the North Korean Embassy took place five days before the start of President Trump’s summit meeting in Vietnam with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.
Ten suspects attacked embassy employees with knives, machetes, metal bars and fake pellet guns, a Spanish judge investigating the case said last week. After holding the employees hostage for several hours, the assailants fled with a cellphone, two pen drives, and two computers and two hard drives that probably contained security footage, the judge reported.
The judge identified the leader of the gang as Adrian Hong Chang, who he said was a Mexican man who lives in the United States. Mr. Hong Chang escaped to the United States and got in touch with the F.B.I., offering to share “audiovisual material” obtained during the embassy attack, the judge said.
An international arrest warrant has also been issued for an American identified as Sam Ruy.
A mysterious organization that describes itself as a dissident group dedicated to toppling Mr. Kim’s regime in Pyongyang has since claimed responsibility. The group, known as Cheollima Civil Defense, or Free Joseon, said on its website that its action at the embassy had not been “an attack,” that no one had been beaten and that no weapons had been used.
The group “shared certain information of enormous potential value with the F.B.I. in the United States, under mutually agreed terms of confidentiality,” it said. “This information was shared voluntarily and on their request, not our own. Those terms appear to have been broken.”
On Thursday, the group said it had been forced to temporarily suspend its operations because of speculative media reports.
The F.B.I. has declined to comment on the case. The State Department in Washington said the United States government had nothing to do with the raid and reiterated that diplomatic missions “ought to be respected and are protected by treaty.”
Lee Wolosky, a lawyer representing the group, said its representatives had been invited into the embassy. “There was no ‘terrorist attack’ — a claim which is itself the propaganda of a designated state sponsor of terrorism,” he said. “In due course, Free Joseon expects to be able to provide to relevant authorities additional evidence concerning what happened in Madrid.”

LOS ANGELES — Law enforcement officials in Los Angeles have appealed to the public for help in capturing a man they say has slashed the faces of at least four people, seemingly at random, as he rides through the city on a bicycle.
The Los Angeles Police Department released photo and video images of the suspect, described as a Latino man between 18 and 30 with a shaved head, wearing a dark brown shirt with a white design and riding a black and green mountain bike. 
Investigators said it was not clear what prompted the attacks across south Los Angeles and surrounding communities or even what he was using for a weapon. 
"For no reason at all he would strike the victims across the face holding something sharp in his hand. Then he would ride away,” Lieutenant Paul Patterson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department told the Los Angeles Times.
The latest two attacks took place on Monday, the LAPD said in a statement, when officers responding to a radio call around 8:40 p.m. found a man suffering from a severe wound to the left side of his face. 
About 15 minutes later, a young woman was slashed nearby.
"He just came in back of me and hit me," Stefany Coboz told local KNBC-TV, displaying a stitched and bandaged wound in her neck that she said would leave permanent scarring. "I just started looking at him, he looked back, I grabbed myself full of blood."
Coboz said her assailant did not speak to her but laughed as he rode away. 
The string of attacks began on March 20, when a male victim was severely injured by the slasher around 7:30 p.m., according to the Los Angeles Police Department. 
A second victim suffered a cut to the face shortly after 11 a.m. on March 27 in the Los Angeles suburb of South Gate, according to police officials.

BEIRUT — A blast in Syria's Raqqa on Wednesday that wounded people was caused by an unexploded mine left by Islamic State going off, not by suicide attacks, the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said.
The head of the SDF's media office Mustafa Bali told journalists in an online message that earlier information it provided about suicide bombings in the city, captured from IS in 2017, was wrong. 
A string of bombings have in recent months targeted the northeastern corner of Syria held by the SDF, even after its capture of the last Islamic State enclave in the area. 
The SDF drove Islamic State from Raqqa in 2017 but the fierce military campaign there, including intensive air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition, left much of the city in ruins.

YANGON — Villagers and a lawmaker in Myanmar’s troubled Rakhine state said on Thursday that a military helicopter attacked a group of Rohingya Muslims gathering bamboo, killing five and wounding 13, but a military spokesman declined to comment.
Major-General Tun Tun Nyi said the army would release "true news" about the alleged incident in time.
Myanmar's western Rakhine state came to global attention in 2017, when the army drove about 730,000 ethnic Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh following attacks by Rohingya insurgents on police posts.
The United Nations has accused the army of cracking down on the Muslim minority with "genocidal intent".
More recently, the military has been fighting another armed group, the Arakan Army, which recruits mostly from the ethnic Rakhine Buddhist population.
The latest incident occurred in a valley in Buthidaung township, near a village that was home to Rohingya Muslim families. 
"A military airstrike killed five people, including one of our villagers, at around 4 pm yesterday," Zaw Kir Ahmed, a community leader from Kin Taung village told Reuters by telephone.
"People in the village don’t dare to go out and are frightened," he added.
Many villages around Buthidaung were razed during the 2017 campaign against Rohingya, though the village that was home to the casualties from Wednesday's attack was spared at that time.
Myanmar’s leaders have vowed to crush all the rebels fighting for autonomy in Rakhine State, an area long scarred by complex ethnic divisions, and authorities have blocked most aid agencies' access to the area, raising fears of more civilian suffering.
Stephan Sakalian, head of delegation in Myanmar at the International Committee of the Red Cross, said teams from the organization had visited Buthidaung Hospital where 13 people were being treated for wounds, some of them in "urgent need of surgery".
"ICRC and Myanmar Red Cross teams are following the situation very closely and offered our services in case of need, including medical supplies or transfer to the Sittwe hospital, as we did two weeks ago with 5 wounded civilians," he said.
Rashid Ahmed, a laborer who spoke by telephone to Reuters, said his elder brother, uncle and nephew had been shot while they were working at Sai Din valley.
"A helicopter attacked them while they were working there, cutting and collecting bamboo," he said. Two other villagers said a helicopter had attacked the group.
Some of the wounded were brought to Buthidaung town, but several died before they reached the hospital, said Maung Kyaw Zan, a lawmaker for the township, adding that five bodies had been recovered.
"When I talked to the wounded people they said the shooting came from the air, there were no clashes on the ground," the lawmaker said. 
More than 17,000 people have been displaced by the violence in Rakhine since December, the U.S. embassy said in a statement on Tuesday that urged authorities to allow humanitarian relief for those affected.
"The United States is deeply concerned about the harm to civilians of the ongoing conflict in Rakhine and Chin States between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military," it said. 
"We call on all parties to renew their efforts to end the fighting and work toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict."

KABUL, Afghanistan — The Taliban ambushed a convoy escorting the vice president of Afghanistan, killing at least one of his bodyguards, Afghan officials said Sunday. The vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, survived.
General Dostum, the leader of the Uzbek ethnic minority in Afghanistan and a bitter foe of the Taliban, had just returned to Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province in northern Afghanistan, after a personal trip to Uzbekistan. On Saturday evening, he was traveling to his home province of Jowzjan when his convoy came under attack for about an hour in the village of Timorak, in Balkh.
The convoy pressed on to Jowzjan Province, where it was again ambushed by the insurgents, according to Amanuddin, head of the local police in Timorak.
Mr. Amanuddin, who like many Afghans uses only one name, said the attackers had destroyed one of General Dostum’s vehicles and killed three of his bodyguards. “Their guys lied about the casualties to the media,” he said, referring to early reports that no one had been killed.
Munir Ahmad Farhad, the spokesman for the governor of Balkh Province, confirmed that the two ambushes had taken place, but said that only one bodyguard had been killed and two others wounded.
Kanishka Turkistani, an aide to General Dostum, also said that a single bodyguard had been killed and two wounded. He said the general’s convoy had actually been ambushed three times and that his guards had captured two insurgents and wounded or killed 10 others.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the insurgents had killed four bodyguards but that none of their fighters had been hurt.
General Dostum, a protégé and longtime favorite of the Central Intelligence Agency, has survived at least two other attacks by the Taliban, who blame him — as do international observers — for the deaths of thousands of Taliban prisoners, many of whom suffocated in truck containers in late 2001 after surrendering to his forces.
In 2014, Ashraf Ghani, who was then running for president, added General Dostum to his ticket as a candidate for one of the country’s two vice-presidential posts, despite having earlier described him as a “known killer.”
Two years later, General Dostum was accused, along with nine of his top security officials and bodyguards, of kidnapping, torturing and raping a political rival, Ahmad Ishchi, who was then in his early 60s. General Dostum left for exile in Turkey, claiming medical issues, but remained vice president when he returned last year.
Despite the criminal charges against them, General Dostum and his more senior security aides have yet to be prosecuted on the rape charges. Seven of his low-level bodyguards were convicted and sentenced to five years in prison in the same case, although they were never arrested or imprisoned, and were even seen on television in the general’s heavily armed entourage.
[General Dostum has been accused of numerous crimes, including rape, kidnapping and the murder of his first wife.]
While apparently immune from prosecution, General Dostum was sidelined from his vice-presidential duties, and has announced that he will be supporting Mr. Ghani’s rival, Abdullah Abdullah, in this year’s presidential race, if it takes place.
When he arrived on Saturday in Mazar-i-Sharif, where there is a large Uzbek minority, General Dostum addressed a crowd of his supporters. He predicted that he would be ambushed by the Taliban when he returned that night to Jowzjan, which is exactly what happened.
“I have been informed that we face an ambush,” he said. “Listen to me: It is not good to stone a wasp’s nest.”
General Dostum also criticized the peace process and boasted that he could quickly defeat the Taliban in the north with the help of his own armed followers if the government would let him. He recalled how in 2001 he and his men went into battle against the Taliban on horseback, supported by the C.I.A. His more recent attempts to battle the Taliban using private militias have had little success.

KABUL, Afghanistan — A large attack by the Taliban in western Afghanistan on Thursday killed at least 30 soldiers and police officers, Afghan officials said, in a sign of intensifying spring fighting across the country despite American efforts to reach a peace deal.
Hundreds of Taliban fighters stormed the center of Bala Murghab District in Badghis Province in the predawn hours, according to Abdul Waris Shirzad, the district governor. The district has come under intense insurgent pressure in recent weeks, with officials warning that it could fall unless reinforcements are sent in.
“No one is hearing our voice; no reinforcements arrived yet,” said Mr. Shirzad, who confirmed that 30 police officers and soldiers had died in the Taliban raid.
He said the insurgents had surrounded police forces in the governor’s office and soldiers on an army base. “If the government does not send more forces, there will be a disaster in the district,” he added.
Jamshid Shahabi, a spokesman for the governor of Badghis, said “both sides suffered casualties” in the attack. He did not provide casualty figures, but added, “The security situation is very bad there.”
The Taliban attacks are intensifying at a time when Zalmay Khalilzad, the American special envoy, is visiting Afghanistan to build a national consensus on the peace talks with the insurgents. Although the Americans have made progress in negotiations over two components of a deal, including withdrawing American troops from the country and barring terrorist groups from staging attacks on the United States and its allies from Afghan soil, the next steps in the peace process have proved difficult.
Although the insurgents have shown flexibility in meeting Afghan officials as part of a larger informal delegation to break the ice, the Taliban have so far refused to meet directly with the Afghan government, and President Ashraf Ghani has demanded that his government play a central role in the talks. The tense relationship between Mr. Ghani’s government and the United States in recent weeks has not helped the situation.
The Taliban have made inroads into Bala Murghab District, reaching its bazaar and attacking five security outposts. Twenty-one soldiers were taken prisoner by the insurgents during the attack on Thursday, according to a member of the Afghan Parliament, Ziauddin Akazi, who is from the same district. “The district will collapse to the Taliban if reinforcement does not arrive,” he stressed.
Qais Mangal, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, said of the Taliban offensive, “Afghan forces retreated from several outposts to avoid civilian casualties.”
On Thursday, the Afghan Air Force launched airstrikes against the Taliban around the district, and the insurgents suffered heavy casualties, Mr. Mangal said.
Violence also erupted in northern Afghanistan on Thursday. In Baghlan Province, a doctor, Sayid Ali Ayat, was killed and 18 civilians wounded — including two women and two children — when explosives went off in a health facility in Pul-i-Kumri City, the provincial capital, local officials said.
Dr. Ayat, 50, had been the only psychiatrist in the provincial hospital. Their numbers are already low amid high demand in a country awash in post-traumatic stress syndrome. There are only three other psychiatrists in the province, according to Abdul Halim Ghafari, the deputy of the provincial health department.
In Jowzjan Province, the Taliban attacked a security outpost in Faizabad District before dawn on Thursday, killing six police officers and wounding another. Local authorities said that four Taliban fighters were killed in the clashes.
Last Monday, dozens of Taliban fighters also attacked security outposts in the district, killing 15 soldiers and wounding seven others, local officials said. Two soldiers were taken prisoner by the insurgents.

ROME — Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on Wednesday ruled out that Economy Minister Giovanni Tria, who is under fire from within the ruling coalition, could step down.
Tria, a 70-year-old academic who is not a member of either of the ruling parties - the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement - has often struggled to get along with his political backers.
"All ministers should stay calm ... there is nothing on the agenda," Conte said during a visit to Qatar when asked about rumors that Tria could quit.
Simmering tensions erupted this week over what 5-Star sees as Tria's reluctance to approve a decree to reimburse savers who suffered losses in a series of bank collapses.
The government has set aside 1.5 billion euros ($1.68 billion) for the reimbursement, which was among 5-Star's campaign promises ahead of last year's election. Tria fears it will fall foul of European Union rules governing bank rescues.
He has drawn up a compromise proposal which would automatically reimburse less-affluent savers, and set up a special commission to judge the claims of better-off investors.
However, this has not satisfied 5-Star, which is struggling in opinion polls and fears it will be accused of reneging on a core election promise.
"Tria can't decide this on his own. We will have savers on the streets," a senior 5-Star lawmaker who asked not to be named told Reuters. 
A source close to Tria said the minister had already got the European Commission to informally sign off on his plan, and "if 5-Star upset everything there will be no reimbursements and it will be the poorest savers who suffer".
Tria himself dismissed speculation he was ready to resign as "rubbish", in comments to daily Corriere della Sera on Wednesday. "If I were to go, we'd have to see how markets would react," he was quoted as saying.
Tria has repeatedly clashed with the ruling parties since the government was formed last June, especially during a drawn-out tussle over Rome's 2019 budget when he wanted to commit to a lower deficit than they did.
The League is taking a back seat in the latest hostilities but this could change if they escalate, because it will be reluctant to allow 5-Star to be seen as the main champion of savers' rights.
The League has overtaken 5-Star as Italy's most popular party, according to opinion polls, with both campaigning hard ahead of European parliamentary elections next month.
"Tria's position is not in question at the moment, but anything can happen after the European vote," a senior League lawmaker told Reuters.

WASHINGTON — The House voted Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration for pushing a federal appeals court to obliterate the Affordable Care Act, and it urged the Justice Department to defend the law in court.
The vote, 240-186, was nonbinding, but it documented the House’s support of the health law, which was passed nine years ago without the votes of any Republicans. With the resolution, Democrats sought to put Republicans on the record for failing to come to the defense of the health law’s most popular provisions, such as protecting people with pre-existing medical conditions and mandating coverage for “essential health benefits,” like mental health coverage, prescription drugs, emergency services and maternity care.
Eight Republicans voted for it. One Democrat opposed.
“The Affordable Care Act is the law of the land, and it is the responsibility of the Justice Department and the administration to defend the law of the land in court,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California said. “What are they doing? Just the opposite. Why? Because they don’t believe in governance. That is why they are happy to shut down government.”
The resolution, which expresses the sentiment of the House but is not subject to approval by the Senate or by President Trump, states, “The actions taken by the Trump administration seeking the invalidation of the A.C.A.’s protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and later the invalidation of the entire A.C.A., are an unacceptable assault on the health care of the American people.”
Republicans called it an empty gesture.
“This will do nothing for your health care,” said the House Republican leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California. “But what will it do? It will make a great press release.”
Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, said the resolution was a political screed and “doesn’t do a darn thing to protect people with pre-existing conditions.”
“Democrats would rather play politics with health care and attack the president for political purposes, rather than work with us on what could and should be bipartisan solutions,” Mr. Walden said.
Democrats relished the opportunity to test Republicans’ commitment to health care, an issue sure to figure in 2020 elections.
“I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle repeatedly claim that they stand for protections for people with pre-existing conditions and for other protections included in the Affordable Care Act,” said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. “Well, now is your chance to show it.”
A federal judge in Texas invalidated all of the Affordable Care Act in December. Last week the Trump administration told the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, that it agreed with the judge’s decision. California and other states that support the Affordable Care Act have appealed the decision.
If the entire law is struck down, millions of people could lose coverage provided through the expansion of Medicaid and through private insurance subsidized by the federal government.
Republicans have voted dozens of times to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and many were reluctant this week to criticize the position taken in court by the Trump administration. But they said they would be ready to respond if the law falls to a legal challenge.
“If the court strikes down the Affordable Care Act, Republicans will act to protect those with pre-existing conditions,” said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the senior Republican on the Ways and Means Committee. “We will work to make health care more affordable, guaranteeing that folks can see local doctors or go to their local hospitals, and we will preserve other important provisions, such as no lifetime limits and allowing kids to stay on their parents’ plans until age 26.”
At the same time, Mr. Brady called the existing health law unconstitutional and called the resolution criticizing the Justice Department a “political stunt.”
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is working on legislation to hold down insurance costs and reverse what Democrats describe as the administration’s efforts to sabotage the health law.
But Senate Republicans have been badly divided as they consider a response to Mr. Trump’s announcement late Monday on Twitter that the party was “developing a really great HealthCare Plan” to replace the Affordable Care Act.
Some, averse to an election-year fight on the issue, have said they would wait to see what Mr. Trump might propose. Some have praised him for raising the issue again.
“Back home, what we have right now is an unmitigated disaster,” said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia. “As an elected official, it’s our responsibility to bring solutions. And what President Trump is saying is that if Congress is gridlocked right now, which it is on this topic, then he wants to start a dialogue about what it is he stands for. And I applaud that.”
But Mr. Trump pulled back his request for a health-law replacement after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, told him no such legislation would be coming before the 2020 election.
Opinion polls show that Democrats have a political advantage on health care. Asked why voters should trust Republicans to replace the Affordable Care Act, after they failed in 2017, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, said, “I would understand their skepticism.”
The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the health law’s requirement for people to have insurance — the individual mandate — as an exercise of Congress’s taxing power. Judge Reed O’Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth ruled that the requirement became unconstitutional after Congress brought that tax penalty to zero in the tax cut signed by Mr. Trump in 2017, and he said that other provisions of the law could not survive because they were inextricably linked to the mandate.
Two Republican state attorneys general, Dave Yost of Ohio and Tim Fox of Montana, filed a legal brief this week saying there was “no basis” to strike down the whole law just because the individual mandate was unconstitutional.
They said the mandate could be severed from the health law without throwing out other provisions, like the protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The Justice Department under Mr. Trump initially said that the mandate and the protections for people with pre-existing conditions should be struck down. But last week, the department went further and said it agreed with the Texas judge who ruled the entire law was invalid.

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand — Brenton Harrison Tarrant, the Australian man accused of killing 50 people last month at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, appeared in court on Friday via video link from prison to face dozens of additional charges.
With the relatives of several victims watching in a Christchurch courtroom — along with wounded survivors, including two men in wheelchairs — Mr. Tarrant was officially charged with 50 counts of murder and 39 charges of attempted murder, as prosecutors added to the solo charge they laid against him in March.
Appearing onscreen from Auckland, handcuffed and wearing a gray shirt, Mr. Tarrant sat still and said nothing.
Judge Cameron Mander of the Christchurch High Court moved quickly through the hearing, the first of several in what could be a process lasting more than a year.
He ordered a pair of health assessments for Mr. Tarrant, 28, with the results due at his next appearance, scheduled for June 14. A plea, the judge said, would follow the results of the assessments.
If Mr. Tarrant is found guilty, he could be sentenced to life in prison without parole. No one in New Zealand has ever received that sentence, but judges have the right to impose it for particularly heinous murders.
New Zealand does not have the death penalty.
Judge Mander also approved several suppression orders that will prevent certain details of the proceedings from being reported by the news media.
The 39 names of victims linked to the attempted murder charges cannot be published, the judge said, to protect them from “undue hardship.” Images of Mr. Tarrant cannot be published without his face being pixelated; no photos, video or audio can be recorded in court.
International news outlets not subject to New Zealand jurisdiction could be barred from Mr. Tarrant’s trial if they do not comply, Judge Mander said.
Mr. Tarrant had previously said he planned to represent himself, but two defense lawyers from Auckland acted on his behalf — Shane Tait and a colleague, Jonathan Hudson.
In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Tait said the right to consult a lawyer, along with the right to a fair trial, were protected under New Zealand law. He said he would not comment further on the case or his role.
Mr. Tarrant’s appearance took place as the New Zealand government has moved quickly to ban military-style weapons and as officials continue to investigate how the gunman was able to carry out the attacks.
The gunman is believed to have posted a hate-filled manifesto online shortly before carrying out the killings, which were then livestreamed on Facebook.
On Thursday, over the objections of technology companies, Australia passed a law requiring social media platforms to quickly remove “abhorrent violent material.” New Zealand is also considering putting restrictions on social media.

A New York man who discussed an American re-enactment of the New Zealand mosque massacre with white supremacist friends on Facebook was charged Thursday with lying to F.B.I. agents, law enforcement officials said.
According to the criminal complaint, Thomas Alonzo Bolin, 22, was charged on Wednesday with lying to federal agents in an interview last week about whether he owned firearms, the Office of the United States Attorney for the Western District of New York said. He was already in custody on state charges filed Saturday.
The office said the F.B.I. had been investigating Mr. Bolin, who lives in the Rochester suburb of Greece, N.Y., for possible violations of federal civil rights and firearms laws.
It was not clear on Thursday whether Mr. Bolin had made any specific plans for violence. But in Facebook messages he had praised the March 15 mass killing of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, according to the criminal complaint. He also discussed his desire to commit acts of violence in the messages, which were intercepted by law enforcement officials.
The F.B.I. said Mr. Bolin used the alias Peter Vincent to share video of the Christchurch attack, which was livestreamed by the shooter on Facebook and spread to Twitter, Reddit and YouTube. Mr. Bolin also used that alias to be active in white supremacist Facebook groups and discuss potential violence with his cousin, Austin Witkowski, the agency said.
A law enforcement official said Mr. Witkowski, who used the Facebook alias Ragnar Odinson, had not been arrested. The official said his whereabouts was unknown.
The F.B.I. used Facebook messages to map out weeks of racist conversations between the two men, who appeared to share a specific hostile fixation on Muslims, according to the complaint.
On the day of the Christchurch attack, the two men also talked to each other about the manifesto published by the gunman and shared their hope that a similar massacre would happen in the United States.
The F.B.I. said Mr. Bolin talked to his cousin about the New Zealand gunman, telling him, “Brugh dude killed 40 muslims.” Mr. Witkowski responded with a heart emoji and the word, “Lovely.”
Both men talked to other Facebook users about the Christchurch attack, the F.B.I. said, and their desire to emulate it in the United States, although those other users are not identified in the criminal complaint.
Talking about the shooting with one of those unidentified Facebook users, Mr. Brolin said “there is a war brewing” and “realistically this was a small piece of a bigger picture now we wait for the retaliation.”
The criminal complaint alleges that Mr. Witkowski made more specific threats. Speaking to an unidentified Facebook user, Mr. Witkowski said he wanted to see the Christchurch attacks copied in the United States and then said he was willing to “do something as of next week” in Baltimore.
The complaint said Mr. Witkowski told the other Facebook user to buy firearms, ammunition and food, and said that he would travel to meet him the next week. The complaint does not say if the meeting ever happened.
The day after the shooting, Mr. Bolin and Mr. Witkowski expressed frustration to each other that they had not been able to carry out an attack. According to the complaint, Mr. Bolin said he had broken his arm in a car accident.
Using an expletive, Mr. Witkowski responded that the broken arm would complicate an unspecified plan they had made. Mr. Bolin then reassured him, saying it only “takes one arm to fire a Glock.”
Mr. Witkowski wrote back saying he would carry out their plan himself. “I’m not waiting months and months or a week,” he said. “It was supposed to be done by Halloween.”
Later that day, Mr. Witkowski wrote to his cousin: “Words aren’t going to help. Violence is the key.” The F.B.I. said Mr. Bolin then cautioned his cousin not to say anything more on Facebook.
“Yoooo chill,” he wrote. “Not on the fed book.” Mr. Witkowski replied that he did not care.
Using the Peter Vincent alias, Mr. Bolin managed a Facebook group called Odin’s Warriors, which did not appear to be active on Thursday. The F.B.I. said Mr. Bolin and his cousin were members of a neo-pagan religious group called “Folk Odinism” that worships the gods of Norse mythology and limits its membership to white heterosexuals.
The criminal complaint said investigators linked Mr. Bolin to the Peter Vincent account by combing through Facebook messages, where Mr. Vincent once told someone that his “real name is Thomas Bolin, Peter Vincent is a character from a horror movie.” (That was most likely the 1985 vampire movie “Fright Night,” or the 2011 remake.)
Facebook provided the F.B.I. with Mr. Bolin’s messages on March 21 as part of a “voluntary emergency disclosure of subscriber and content information,” the agency said. A representative for the company said it shares user information with law enforcement without going through a formal legal process only when it believes there to be an imminent risk of serious injury or death.
“White supremacy, hate groups, and hate speech are not allowed on Facebook, and we also recently announced a ban on praise or support of white nationalism,” the company said in a statement. “We remove any content that violates our policies and work with law enforcement when we think there is a genuine risk of real-world harm.”

COLUMBUS, Ohio — Officers at an Ohio prison watched and laughed behind a locked door as an inmate slipped his handcuffs, pulled out a homemade blade, and repeatedly stabbed four fellow prisoners who were handcuffed to a table and couldn't defend themselves, according to a civil rights lawsuit filed Wednesday by two of the injured men.
Shamieke Pugh and Maurice Lee also allege that officers hadn't strip-searched the attacker as required and didn't provide first aid to the bleeding inmates for more than 10 minutes after the June 2017 attack at the maximum-security Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville.
All four survived the attack, which occurred as they were playing cards at a table near where the attacker had been seated. It was recorded on prison surveillance video obtained by The Associated Press.
Lee, now 27, was stabbed twice. Pugh, now 29, said he was stabbed at least 10 times before another inmate freed himself and tackled the assailant.
The man acting in self-defense was pepper-sprayed by officers, but the attacker wasn't, according to the federal lawsuit.
The suit filed against the warden, two officers and other staff members alleges violations of constitutional rights, including deliberate indifference to potential harm and different treatment of the attacker, who is white, compared with the other inmates, who are black. It also alleges prison staff knew the attacker was a safety threat but failed to prevent the violence.
Pugh believes guards set up the stabbing.
"I did a crime, and I did my time, but the guards got away scot-free after almost killing me," Pugh said. "That ain't right."
The attacker, Greg Reinke, has denied the officers arranged the attack but said they condoned it. Reinke also "stated that he just felt like killing someone," according to a prison report.
The Scioto County prosecutor said he found no evidence of a setup.
Reviews of what happened found that guards followed prison policies and procedures, and no officers were disciplined, said Chris Mabe, the president of the union that represents the officers.
One of the inmates' attorneys, Solomon Radner, argues that the guards' conduct violated constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment.
"I don't care what the policies are. I don't care what the procedures are," Radner said. "I know what the Eighth Amendment is."
The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it doesn't comment on pending litigation.
Prison officials wouldn't say how Reinke smuggled homemade knives from his cell and slipped his cuffs. The officers' union previously said Lucasville has since ended the practice of shackling multiple inmates seated at a table.
Reinke already was serving life in prison for a 2004 shooting in Cleveland. He was sentenced last week to an additional 86 years for the 2017 attack and a guard's stabbing last year.
Pugh spent two weeks in the hospital being stabbed. The lawsuit also alleges he was punched and kicked by different officers while shackled a year later when he experienced chest pain and sought medical treatment from prison nurses, then was denied medical treatment for resulting injuries.
Pugh was released from prison in December after serving several years for burglary. Lee, now at Madison Correctional Institution, is serving a 10-year sentence on charges including aggravated robbery.
Their lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
Having video of the attack is extremely important to the case because it provides evidence in a situation that might otherwise be just the guards' word versus the inmates' word, Radner said. He said he hopes the case prompts conversations about having corrections officers wear body cameras as police do.

YANGON — Myanmar's military said on Friday six Rohingya Muslims killed and nine wounded in an aerial attack in the western state of Rakhine this week were affiliated with an armed rebel group. 
The army-run Myawady newspaper said the villagers were "together with terrorists while the army was cracking down on the Arakan Army's terrorist activities" on Wednesday in the township of Buthidaung.
Rakhine state came to global attention in 2017, when the Myanmar army drove about 730,000 ethnic Rohingya across the border into neighbouring Bangladesh, following attacks by Rohingya insurgents on police posts.
The United Nations has accused the army of 'genocidal intent' in cracking down on the Muslim minority. 
More recently, the military has been battling another armed group, the Arakan Army, which draws recruits mostly from the ethnic Rakhine population.
The men were collecting bamboo near the Sai Din waterfall when an army helicopter attacked, three villagers and a regional lawmaker told Reuters on Thursday.
"All of them were bamboo workers," said Soe Tun Oo, a fellow labourer.
Arakan Army spokesman Khin Thu Kha denied the dead and wounded men were members of the armed group, saying the military had attacked indiscriminately.
"They bombed everywhere, believing there were Arakan Army members in the jungle," he added.
Ten people are being treated at the Buthidaung public hospital, Kyaw Min Tun, a hospital official, said on Friday.
In a statement, the military said nine injured were taken to a military-run hospital for treatment.
But a military spokesman, Tun Tun Nyi, declined to comment on the discrepancy between the accounts.
In Geneva, a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said the organisation was "deeply disturbed" by the escalating violence in Rakhine and condemned "what appear to be indiscriminate attacks and attacks directed at civilians".
Ravina Shamdasani said there were "credible reports of the killing of civilians, burning of houses, arbitrary arrests, abductions, indiscriminate fire in civilian areas, and damage to cultural property".
She cited sources on the ground as saying at least seven people were killed on Wednesday and that the attack was carried out in an area where thousands of Rohingya were taking shelter having fled earlier fighting.
"As the international community is taking steps towards accountability for the crimes committed against civilians in previous years, the Myanmar military is again carrying out attacks against its own civilians - attacks which may constitute war crimes," she said. 
More than 20,000 people have been displaced by the violence across five townships in Rakhine state, she said, urging authorities to allow humanitarian relief for those affected.
The United States embassy in Myanmar said this week it was "deeply concerned about the harm to civilians of the ongoing conflict in Rakhine and Chin States between the Arakan Army and the Myanmar military."
"We call on all parties to renew their efforts to end the fighting and work toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict."

At least 118 pro-government forces and 10 civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the past week.
By Fahim Abed
The following report compiles all significant security incidents confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the past seven days. It is necessarily incomplete as many local officials refuse to confirm casualty information. The report includes government claims of insurgent casualty figures, but in most cases these cannot be independently verified by The Times. Similarly, the reports do not include Taliban claims for their attacks on the government unless they can be verified. Both sides routinely inflate casualty totals for their opponents.
Nearly 120 security forces and 10 civilians were killed in the past week, The deadliest attack took place in Badghis Province on Thursday, when the Taliban attacked Bala Murghab district center, killing at least 30 soldiers and police officers. At least 21 soldiers were taken prisoners and five security outposts were taken by insurgents. No reinforcements arrived despite many calls for support. In a separate incident, 15 soldiers were killed, seven others were wounded and two soldiers were taken prisoner when dozens of Taliban fighters attacked army outposts in the same district on Monday. In Oruzgan Province, local officials claimed that between 10 and 13 civilians were killed and five others were wounded in an American airstrike on a hotel located along the Oruzgan-Kandahar highway. The provincial governor’s office and the Kandahar police chief said there were no civilians killed in the airstrike.

Sydney (Reuters) - Australia's Senate censured an independent right-wing lawmaker on Wednesday for his comments that New Zealand's mosques shooting massacre which left 50 people dead was a result of letting "Muslim fanatics" migrate to the country.
Senator Fraser Anning has been widely condemned for his comments made shortly after a lone gunman attacked two mosques in Christchurch on March 15.
"There is no room for racism in Australia. Sadly, what Senator Anning said after the Christchurch massacre, however shocking isn't out of character," Australian Muslim Senator Mehreen Faruqi told the Senate.
"Just a week before I joined this place, he gave a speech calling for a ban on people like me coming to this country."
Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with one murder following the attack and was remanded without a plea. He is due back in court on April 5, when police said he was likely to face more charges.
Sitting for the first time since the attack, Australia's upper house overwhelmingly passed a censure motion against Anning - the first such public rebuke of a lawmaker in four years. A censure motion has no direct legal consequences but acts as an expression of the Senate's disapproval.
Senator Anning denied he had blamed the victims, insisting the censure was an attack on his civil liberties.
"This censure motion against me is a blatant attack on free speech," Anning told Reuters via email. 
Leaders of the major parties in the Senate condemned Anning's comments, with opposition Labor Senator Penny Wong rejecting his "free speech" defense.
"There is a difference between freedom of speech and hate speech. The former is a feature of our democracy. The latter is an attack on democracy," Wong said.
"This motion makes it clear he doesn’t speak for us. He doesn’t speak for the Senate. He doesn’t speak for this nation. He doesn’t represent Australian values."
Anning's comments gained international attention after footage of a teenager smashing an egg on the head of the right-wing senator was widely shared on social media.

SYDNEY — The Australian man accused of killing 50 Muslim worshippers in gun attacks on two mosques in Christchurch will face 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges, New Zealand police said on Thursday.
"Other charges are still under consideration," police said in a statement.
Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was previously charged with only one murder following the attack and has been remanded without a plea.
He is due back in court on Friday. The March 15 attack was the worst mass shooting by a lone gunman in New Zealand.

OUAGADOUGOU — More than 60 civilians have been killed in tit-for-tat clashes between communities in northern Burkina Faso in recent days, the government said on Wednesday, the latest in a bout of inter-communal violence afflicting West Africa's Sahel region.
Burkina and neighboring Mali have seen a spike in ethnic clashes fueled by Islamist militants as they seek to extend their influence over the Sahel, an arid region between Africa's northern Sahara desert and its southern savannas.
Islamist attacks have risen in recent months, and the violence has reignited long-standing tensions between communities as certain groups are blamed for collaborating with the jihadists. 
New violence arose near the town of Arbinda in Burkina's Soum province on Sunday night, when a religious leader and six of his family members were killed by unidentified armed men, the ruling Movement of People for Progress (MPP) party said in a statement on Wednesday.
"On the morning of April 1st, reprisal acts were reported in the Arbinda Department. They were directed against a community following the assassination of a religious leader," said MPP spokesman Bindi Ouoba.
The MPP statement said a royal family was also attacked in neighboring Boulgou province on Sunday night, leaving at least nine dead.
Territorial Administration Minister Simeon Sawadogo said on state TV late on Wednesday that 62 people died in the Arbinda attack. 
"Thirty deaths were the result of inter-communal conflicts, and 32 people were killed by terrorists," said Sawadogo, adding that militants had taken nine hostages. 
Deteriorating security prompted the government to declare a state of emergency in several northern provinces bordering Mali in December, which was extended by six months after jihadists attacked civilians in Soum.
Burkina Faso, which had previously been known for its stability in a troubled region, has suffered 499 deaths from attacks on civilians between November 2018 and March 23 - a more than 7,000 percent jump from the same period a year earlier.

CHRISTCHURCH — The Australian man accused of killing 50 worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand faced an additional 49 murder charges in court on Friday and was ordered to undergo a mental assessment to determine his fitness for trial over the attacks.
In an attack broadcast live on Facebook, a lone gunman armed with semi-automatic weapons targeted Muslims attending Friday prayers in Christchurch on March 15.
Brenton Tarrant, 28, was charged with one murder the day after the attack and remanded without a plea. In Christchurch's High Court, where he appeared by video link, 39 extra attempted murder charges were also filed along with the new murder charges.
Justice Cameron Mander remanded Tarrant in custody until June 14 and ordered he undergo a mental assessment to determine whether he was fit for trial.

LONDON — A man has been charged with five counts of attempted murder following a series of stabbings in north London which have heightened public concern about rising knife crime in Britain.
Jason Kakaire, 29, will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court later on Friday, police said.
The attacks began on Saturday night when four people were stabbed overnight. A fifth victim was found with knife wounds early on Tuesday morning. 
The latest attack came a day after Prime Minister Theresa May hosted a security summit at her Downing Street office to discuss ways of stemming the rise in knife crime.
Last year, there were 285 fatal stabbings in England and Wales, the highest number since records began more than 70 years ago. At least 48 people in Britain have been stabbed to death since the start of 2019. 
After the north London attacks, a woman remains in hospital with life-changing injuries, while two men are in stable condition. The other two victims have been discharged from hospital.

BUCHAREST — The United States on Friday condemned the vandalising of a Jewish cemetery in Romania's eastern town of Husi, where 73 tombstones were found destroyed by unidentified perpetrators, and urged authorities to bring those responsible to justice.
The case follows an attack last year on Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel's memorial home in north Romania's Sighet - painted with anti-Semitic fluorescent pink graffiti which led to the rapid arrest of the perpetrator, a 37-year-old man.
"The destruction of dozens of Jewish graves is not only an attack against the Jewish community, but also an attack against the diversity of the entire Romanian society," the U.S. embassy said in a statement.
"We stand together with the Jewish families whose loved ones' graves were desecrated and call for those responsible for this attack to be brought to justice," it said.
Husi mayor Ioan Ciupilan, told local paper Vremea Noua after he visited the place he felt sorry about the incident, adding: "over the past 60 years no one has heard of a similar deed."
"I can't give a verdict myself that a human did this."
Romania was an ally of Nazi Germany during World War Two until it changed sides in August 1944. An international commission in a 2004 report put the total number of Romanian and Ukrainian Jews who perished in territories under Romanian administration at 280,000 to 380,000.
The country used to have a pre-war Jewish population of about 800,000 but now fewer than 11,000 Jews live in EU-member Romania with a total population of about 20 million people.
After the collapse of the communist dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, Romania passed laws to return property to the original owners but the process has been hampered by red tape.
It has only in recent years begun to come to terms with its role in the extermination, admitting for the first time in 2003 that it took part. Knowledge of the Holocaust and sensitivity towards it remain patchy.

GENEVA — The United Nations expressed alarm on Friday about civilian deaths and other developing consequences from an escalating conflict between Myanmar’s military, which undertook a brutally violent military campaign against the Rohingya ethnic group, and an insurgent group in a western border region.
Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, said on Friday that the agency believed the violence in Rakhine State had also resulted in destroyed property, arbitrary arrests and abductions in civilian areas. She said that the fighting had displaced over 20,000 people.
Ms. Shamdasani said that at least seven civilians were killed on Wednesday, when two military helicopters bombed and strafed villagers who were tending cattle and working in rice fields. Eighteen more people were injured.
“The Myanmar military is again carrying out attacks against its own civilians,” Ms. Shamdasani said, adding that the attacks “may constitute war crimes.”
The attacks are in area of western Myanmar that in 2017 was the site of much of the violence that Myanmar’s military perpetrated against the Rohingya, which prompted more than 700,000 members of the ethnic group to flee into neighboring Bangladesh. Myanmar has said that its military was merely responding to attacks by Rohingya militants, but United Nations officials called the actions genocide, and said that top generals should face trial in an international court.
United Nations Secretary General António Guterres this week appointed Nicholas Koumjian, an American prosecutor with more than 20 years’ experience in international criminal justice, to lead a special investigative body tasked with preparing case files for prosecuting the most serious crimes arising from the campaign.
But the latest violence largely involves a the Arakan Army, a guerrilla force from the Buddhist ethnic group that makes up the majority population in Rakhine State and finds support among those who feel neglected by the central government.
Arakan Army fighters ambushed border posts in January, and are said to have killed 13 police officers and injured nine more. In response, the Myanmar military deployed thousands of extra troops — reportedly including some of the units involved in the 2017 violence — and launched counterinsurgency operations backed by fighter jets and helicopter gunships.
It also restricted access to northern Rakhine State. Ms. Shamdasani said that humanitarian aid efforts were struggling to reach those displaced by the violence.
She added that United Nations officials were also concerned that fighting had moved from the sparsely populated countryside into urban areas, posing a greater risk to civilians.
The Arakan Army has taken up positions in a number of civilian areas and carried out attacks targeting the police and government officials, Ms. Shamdasani said.
“We expect the violence to escalate,” she added.

CAIRO — Jihadist group Islamic State said on Thursday it had killed 13 Nigerian soldiers and five troops from a west African anti-militant force in attacks over recent days.
Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), which split from Nigeria-based Boko Haram in 2016, has carried out a series of attacks in the last few months.
In its newspaper Al-Nabaa, IS said its fighters killed the Nigerians in attacks on a military barracks on Friday, a military post on Sunday, and a town on Monday, all in northeastern Borno state. 
Fighters also detonated explosives on Wednesday on a vehicle in the Lake Chad region, killing five more soldiers, IS said, without specifying the country. 
The militants said the vehicle was carrying troops from a multinational task force - comprising of troops from Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon - set up to fight them. 
A Nigerian military spokesman declined comment, and a spokesman for the task force could not immediately be reached.
Boko Haram has waged a decade-long insurgency in northeast Nigeria which has killed around 30,000 people and forced about 2 million to leave their homes.

(Reuters) - Convicted sex offender Bill Cosby on Friday settled a federal defamation lawsuit brought by seven women who said the former actor and comedian sexually assaulted them and wrongly called them liars when they went public with their charges years later.
The settlement ends a court fight that predates the 81-year-old's conviction a year ago for drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former Temple University administrator, in 2004. Cosby is currently serving a 3- to 10-year sentence for that crime, though his lawyers plan an appeal.
He was the first celebrity convicted of sexual misconduct since the rise of the #MeToo movement, which cast a harsh light on widespread patterns of sexual harassment or abuse in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in American media, politics and business.
The settlement covers seven of some 50 women who emerged over the past decade to level sex abuse charges against the once-beloved star of "The Cosby Show," who built a decades-long career on a family-friendly style of comedy.
All the allegations but Constand's were too old to be the subject of criminal prosecution, which prompted the seven women to sue for defamation when Cosby accused them of lying.
"Each Plaintiff is satisfied with the settlement," attorneys for Cosby said in papers filed in U.S. District Court in Springfield, Massachusetts, near one of Cosby's homes. They did not disclose the terms of the agreement.
The defamation suit was filed in December 2014. One of the seven, Louisa Moritz, an actress best known for appearing in "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," died in January at age 72.
The other plaintiffs were Barbara Bowman, who said she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress when she was assaulted in 1985; Tamara Green, who said she was a young model in the early 1970s when she was attacked; actress Angela Leslie, who said her attack took place in 1992; Therese Serignese, now a registered nurse who said she was 19 when she was attacked in 1976; Joan Tarshis, who said she was 19 at the time of her attack in 1969; and Linda Traitz, who said she was an 18-year-old waitress when she became a victim in 1969.
Cosby has denied the accusations and maintained his innocence.

LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles police say they are trying to find a bicyclist who rides close to people and slashes their faces. He is believed to have struck six times since last month.
Police in a statement said that a man standing near a bus stop was attacked on Monday and a woman was slashed about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away.
They were hospitalized with severe injuries and are expected to survive.
Similar attacks happened in the same area of South Los Angeles on March 20 and in the neighboring cities of South Gate and Lynwood on March 27.
Police say the assailant has used an unknown type of "edged weapon" and was last seen on a black and green mountain bike.

This is a Boeing 737 in normal flight, pointed up at a so-called angle of attack of a few degrees. Planes are meant to fly within a certain range, effectively a safe zone for flight.
Boeing’s new 737 Max has larger engines placed higher on the plane, creating aerodynamics that can push the nose up in some conditions. If a plane’s angle of attack becomes too steep, it could stall and crash.
Boeing developed an automated system called MCAS that uses stabilizers on the tail to push the nose back down and help the plane to avoid a stall.
MCAS relied on only one of two sensors that measured the plane’s angle of attack. “That’s not a good engineering system,” said Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical engineer. “That’s where they screwed up royally.”
An angle of attack sensor is believed to have provided faulty data in the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes. On the Lion Air flight, a sensor showed that the plane was pointed up at least 20 degrees higher than the other.
The automated system responded by pushing the plane’s nose down to what it thought was a safer angle, investigators believe. But it actually pushed the plane to a potentially dangerous angle.
The Lion Air pilots were left to desperately read through a technical manual, struggling to troubleshoot malfunctioning software mid-flight.
Pilots could use stabilizer controls at their thumbs to temporarily counteract MCAS. But if the system still detected a dangerous angle, it would re-engage, pushing the nose down again. On the Lion Air flight, this created a tug-of-war.
On the Ethiopian Airlines flight, pilots appear to have followed the steps to disengage the system. But even after manually trying to steady the plane, MCAS kept on pushing the plane down until it crashed.
Investigations into both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes are ongoing, and investigators have called for an inquiry into how the Max system works.
Boeing has said that it was updating the MCAS software to rely on data from two sensors, not just one, and to notify pilots if those sensors had conflicting readings. The system would also kick in just once. As part of the update, the company said Max pilots would need to receive an additional 30-minute training program on the software.
“We’re going to do everything that we can do to ensure that accidents like these never happen again,” said Mike Sinnett, a Boeing executive.

The black sedan glided up to the Las Vegas hotel where Elizabeth Suarez was waiting to take an Uber home after a night of gambling. She recalled asking the driver: Are you waiting for Liz? Yeah, he responded. Get in.
She had done it countless times. But that night in July 2018, as the man veered off course toward a deserted parking lot, as he cranked up the radio and ignored her questions, as her real driver called her wondering where she was, Ms. Suarez said she realized with horror: This was not an Uber.
“That’s when he said, ‘Give me your wallet, give me your phone, give me everything you have,’” Ms. Suarez, 28, said.
On busy streets outside bars or clubs, people often hop into a car without a second thought. But the killing of Samantha Josephson, a 21-year-old college student in South Carolina who was stabbed to death after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber last weekend, has brought national attention to a rash of kidnappings, sexual assaults and robberies carried out largely against young women by assailants posing as ride-share drivers.
There have been at least two dozen such attacks in the past few years, according to a tally of publicly reported cases, including instances where suspects have been charged with attacking multiple women. In Connecticut, a man was arraigned last week on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who believed he was their ride-share driver. In Chicago, prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women, climbing into the back seat and pinning them down.
These attacks turn a simple mix-up into a nightmare, showing how easily bad actors can exploit the vulnerabilities of a ride-sharing culture that so many people trust to get them home safe.
[Tips for staying safe when getting into a ride-share vehicle.]
The drivers troll nightclubs and bars late at night to find people scanning the dark for their ride, according to law enforcement descriptions of the assaults. They wave to passengers and say, “I’m your driver.” Some even hang ride-share decals in their windows.
The attacks represent a tiny fraction of the millions of uneventful rides that Americans hail every day. But Ms. Josephson’s murder has forced ride-sharing companies to address renewed safety concerns, led to legislative proposals and public efforts to reduce future attacks, and prompted passengers across the country to weigh the risks of climbing into a stranger’s back seat.
“It could be any one of us,” said Kate Lewis, a junior at the University of South Carolina, where Ms. Josephson had been a senior about to head to law school.
[Have you had a scary experience with what you thought was a ride-share driver? Please share your experiences in the comments.]
State lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law named for Ms. Josephson that would require all ride-share drivers to display a lighted sign from their company. Her father, Seymour Josephson, has become an outspoken advocate for stronger safety measures, saying at a vigil this week, “I don’t want anyone else to go through it as a parent.”
At the University of South Carolina, students have started a new safety campaign that urges riders to ask, “What’s my name?” to ensure they are talking to their actual ride-share drivers before getting into a car.
Students described the campaign as one constructive action they could take amid a week of stunned grief and candlelit vigils, after the police announced on Saturday that they had found Ms. Josephson’s body in the woods 70 miles away. She had last been seen at 2 a.m. Friday in a busy downtown neighborhood in Columbia, S.C., getting into a black Chevrolet Impala.
The security footage of those moments is haunting: As Ms. Josephson gets into the back seat, there are people everywhere, tapping on their phones, hugging one another’s shoulders, enjoying the night.
The police charged Nathaniel David Rowland, 24, with kidnapping and killing Ms. Josephson. They said they had found Ms. Josephson’s blood and her cellphone in Mr. Rowland’s car, along with bleach and cleaning supplies. The child-safety locks had been engaged.
Mr. Rowland has not entered a plea, and his lawyer declined to comment. He was not an Uber driver, the company said.
“Everyone at Uber is devastated to hear about this unspeakable crime,” Grant Klinzman, a company spokesman, said in an email. “We spoke with the University of South Carolina president and will be partnering with the university to raise awareness on college campuses nationwide about this incredibly important issue.”
Uber sent a message to its users on Thursday advising them to match the license plate, car make and model and to check the driver’s photograph before taking a ride.
In the wake of reports of Ms. Josephson’s death, Carla Westlund, 30, thought once again about the night in 2017 when she was raped in Los Angeles by a man she mistakenly thought was her Uber driver. She said she fell asleep in the back seat of the car and woke to him beating her head against the seat.
“He had an Uber sticker,” she said. “He was pretending to be an Uber driver.”
After three hours in his car, Ms. Westlund said she was able to convince the man to let her go outside her boyfriend’s house, and she immediately reported the attack and went to the hospital. Ms. Westlund said she felt re-victimized by reporting the crime — a common complaint from sexual-assault survivors. She said that she had given additional details of the attack as she remembered more with each retelling, but that the officers had characterized this as changing her story.
“I felt like I was definitely being treated like I did something wrong,” she said. She now volunteers with PAVE, a nonprofit that works to end sexual violence.
In February 2018, Nicolas Morales was arrested and charged with raping her and six other women by posing as a ride-share driver. He pleaded not guilty and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 8.
Uber and Lyft have been criticized in the past for not adequately vetting their drivers or doing enough to ensure passenger safety, which has led to temporary bans or restrictions on the services in some cities. A 2018 CNN report found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. The companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority.
Uber said it has worked with law enforcement since 2017 to teach riders how to avoid impostors. Last year, it added a panic button that lets riders tap their screens and dial 911 directly from the app.
Uber and Lyft also distribute glowing dashboard lights in some markets called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. The lights are in limited distribution and not available to all drivers.
Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft who hosts a podcast called The Rideshare Guy, said it was common for people to hop into the wrong car in the crush outside bars, airports, games or concerts, where hundreds of people are jostling for their cars.
“These sorts of mistakes are happening all the time,” Mr. Campbell said. “But there are some bad actors who realize this and take advantage.”
It is not hard to fake, safety experts and law enforcement authorities said.
Knockoff decals and light-up signs saying “Uber” and “Lyft” are easy to buy from major online retailers. Impostors trawl night spots when people have often been drinking and are particularly vulnerable, as they part with friends for the evening and search the dark for an unfamiliar car.
“They’re taking advantage of an individual who’s intoxicated and doesn’t have all their senses. They’re going to overlook little warning signs,” said Lt. Harrison Daniel of the Athens-Clarke County Police in Georgia, where a man was charged with posing as an Uber driver and raping a college student last year.
Identifying the attackers can also be difficult. Unlike actual ride-share drivers, they do not register their personal details in a ride-hailing service’s database, so police have to pull security footage, look for witnesses and search the streets for cars matching a suspect’s vehicle.
The driver who abducted and robbed Ms. Suarez in an empty parking lot behind a grocery store early that morning in July 2018 still has not been arrested, though police said the investigation was active.
Ms. Suarez escaped by jumping out of his moving car. She cracked her skull and broke her wrist and ankle. When she reported the attack, she said the police had seemed leery of her story and asked her about how she was dressed and what she had been doing out at 4 a.m.
She decided to speak out about the attack, posting photos of her injuries on social media and talking to a local television station. Some people responded by saying she was “crying wolf” and was to blame for getting into the wrong car.
Ms. Suarez said she believed that the man who attacked her was not there by coincidence that night.
“He was waiting for the right person,” she said. “He knew exactly what time to be out there. I think he’d done it in the past, and he’ll continue to do it. Because he’s still out there.”

LOS ANGELES — A 19-year-old Los Angeles man suspected of slashing at least nine people with a sharp-edged object as he rode through the city on a bicycle has been booked on suspicion of attempted murder, police said on Thursday.
Lenrey Briones was taken into custody shortly after 1 p.m. on Wednesday near a homeless camp where detectives believe he lived, said Officer Rosario Cervantes of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
His arrest came after police released photo and video images of the suspect in the seemingly random attacks, which left parts of America's second-largest city on edge, and called on the public's help in apprehending him.
Local KABC-TV reported that officers were tipped off to Briones by his probation office. A bike resembling the one used by the slasher was found at the homeless camp. 
The string of slashings began on March 20, according to the LAPD. They often took place in broad daylight and included victims ranging in age from 13 to 85.
The latest two attacks occurred on Monday when officers responding to a radio call at around 8:40 p.m. found a man suffering from a severe wound to the left side of his face. 
About 15 minutes later, a young woman was attacked nearby.
"He just came in back of me and hit me," Stefany Coboz told local KNBC-TV, displaying a stitched and bandaged wound in her neck. "I just started looking at him, he looked back, I grabbed myself full of blood."
Coboz said her assailant did not speak to her but laughed as he rode away.

HERAT, Afghanistan — Hundreds of Taliban fighters stormed a district in Afghanistan's western Badghis province, with both Afghan government forces and the insurgent group suffering dozens of casualties, provincial officials said.
The district of Bala Murghab has been a recurring hotspot of fighting in the past two months, and officials have previously warned that it could fall to the Taliban without reinforcements.
Fighting in Afghanistan has escalated ahead of the usual spring season, as both sides seek to increase leverage in talks on a peace settlement. 
The Taliban killed 36 members of the government forces and captured several security checkpoints in attacks that began on Wednesday night, Waris Sherzad, district governor of Bala Murghab, said late on Thursday. Fighting was ongoing, he said.
More than 30 Taliban were also killed, said Jamshed Shahabi spokesman for Badghis' provincial governor. 
Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said it attacked from four directions, capturing five checkpoints. 
Afghanistan's defense ministry, in a series of tweets, said its forces chose to "tactically retreat" from the checkpoints to prevent civilian casualties. The ministry said it called in multiple air strikes on Taliban positions.
The conflict in Badghis has been particularly intense along with northern Kunduz province and Helmand province in the south in recent weeks. Both sides took heavy casualties in Badghis last month, and at one point 50 members of Afghan security forces surrendered to the Taliban.
Fighting between militant groups has also intensified. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement on Thursday that Islamic State attacks on Taliban positions on March 23 resulted in 21,000 people being displaced in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. 
The latest round of peace talks between U.S. and Taliban officials wrapped up last month, with both sides citing progress.

SYDNEY — From its clubhouses in Melbourne and Sydney, the Lads Society promotes drug-free living and exercise, as well as "white resistance" and Islamophobia, according to online statements and interviews with two of its leaders.
One of Australia's most high profile extremist groups, its members last year infiltrated the youth arm of the National Party, part of the ruling coalition government, before being exposed and ejected due to their far right views.
Now, the group has come to prominence again – and to the attention of security agencies – after a gunman shot 50 people dead at two New Zealand mosques.
In the hours after the shootings, the Lads Society's private Facebook page lit up as its members discussed the attack and the man arrested and charged with murder, 28-year-old Australian Brenton Tarrant, according to five screenshots of the Facebook messages which were provided by a person with access to the group and reviewed by Reuters.
"He had been on the scene for a while," said Tom Sewell, founder of the Lads Society, according to the previously undisclosed messages on the Lads Society's Facebook page. 
"He made heaps on Bitcoin and paid for his own holidays, I spoke to him back in 2017 when he was donating money to everyone," added Sewell. 
In a later public statement, Sewell said he and Lads Society leaders were interviewed about the Christchurch attacks by the Australia Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the country's domestic spy agency. 
ASIO said it does not comment on specific individuals, intelligence or operational matters but was alert to the threat from people with "extreme right-wing ideologies". The Australian Federal Police also declined to comment when asked about any ties Tarrant had to the Lads Society.
Sewell declined to comment on Tarrant or whether he knew him, and his messages provided no further details.
Tarrant, who is now in custody and has said he plans to represent himself, was not available for comment. 
The Lads Society's page was shut down after Facebook targeted white nationalists in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. Reuters was unable to verify the claims on the since-deleted Facebook page. 
    However, Sewell's messages to the private group on the Lads Society Facebook page, which carried the same profile photo as a photo posted on Sewell's Instagram account, add to evidence Tarrant was engaged with Australia's far right. 
On the 8Chan message board minutes before the attack, Tarrant posted links to a livestream video of the attack and said: "You are all top blokes and the best bunch of cobbers a man could ask for." Cobber is Australian slang for friend, and a term popular among Australian white nationalists.
As Australia confronts the uncomfortable truth that Tarrant was one of its own, the country has been gripped by acrimonious debate about both its past race policies and whether recent political discourse about immigration and Islam had any role to play in his radicalisation.
In the space of a few minutes outside a Sydney mosque the day after the Christchurch shootings, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison encapsulated the country's contradictory identity.
"We are a tolerant, multicultural society, the most successful immigration country on the planet," he said, before pivoting to a darker undercurrent. "These white supremacist, white separatist views, are not new. I mean, these sentiments have sadly existed in Australia for hundreds of years."
OFF THE RADAR
Tarrant grew up in the small Australian city of Grafton, where he worked as a gym instructor and developed a passion for gaming and computers, according to local media reports citing the gym owner and his grandmother. 
In a "manifesto" distributed online just before the attack, Tarrant said he formed his racist beliefs on the internet and downplayed his links to Australia, saying he was radicalised abroad. 
He acted alone, the manifesto said, although he said he had donated to far-right groups from an inheritance and a cryptocurrency windfall. 
Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz last week confirmed his country's far-right Identitarian Movement had received 1,500 euros ($1,690) from Tarrant.
Most of his past nine years was spent traveling across Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
Tarrant was "on nobody's radar, anywhere," said Morrison, spending only 45 days in the past three years in Australia. 
According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, citing archives of the deleted Facebook account of the United Patriots Front (UPF), another Australian far-right group, Tarrant described one of that group's leaders, Blair Cottrell, as "Emperor". Reuters was unable to independently verify that detail.
Cottrell - a muscle-bound, blond-haired carpenter - founded the UPF alongside Sewell. Sewell later started Lads Society in 2017, with Cottrell's promotional support. Cottrell, described by sources as the movement's main figurehead in Australia, still heads UPF and appears in Lads Society photos and videos but holds no formal position in that group. 
Cottrell told Reuters that, as best he could tell, Tarrant had donated only once to groups he was associated with - A$50 to the UPF. 
"I don't believe I influenced Tarrant much at all. Maybe three years ago, he was in support of our specific opposition to that mosque development in Bendigo."
In 2017, Cottrell and two other UPF members were found guilty of inciting contempt of Muslims after they filmed a mock beheading outside council offices to protest a mosque development in the small Victorian city.
GOING MAINSTREAM
White extremists gained momentum in 2014 after an Islamist gunman took a group of hostages in a Sydney cafe, analysts and members of the movement say. 
The following year, thousands of people attended rallies arranged by anti-Islam group Reclaim Australia, and some far-right politicians spoke at the events.
Suspicions about the presence of Lads Society members in the youth wing of the National Party first emerged after officials of the rural-based party noted an influx of new members from cities. 
After ties to the Lads Society were revealed in local media, the National Party expelled 19 people, saying in a statement in November it "would not rest until every last one of these extremists have been identified and removed." 
In Australia's latest census, about 90 percent nominated their ancestry as Australian or European, while 2.5 percent were recorded as Muslims.
Just under a quarter of Australians have a "negative attitude" to Muslims, according to a 2018 report from the Scanlon Foundation, a group that tracks social cohesion.
FAR-RIGHT SENATOR
In the wake of the Christchurch attacks, Australia's Islamophobes flooded social media with memes and messages in support of Fraser Anning, the Australian senator who blamed the bloodshed on "an immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand".
In an interview with Reuters, Anning said he was "completely opposed" to the attacks in Christchurch.
However, he echoed the "replacement theory" embraced by Tarrant and the global white supremacist movement. Muslims, he said, "are going to outbreed us very quickly".
Anning has picked up 28,600 Facebook followers in the past four weeks, data provided by his office shows, and now has more than 122,000 followers. 
Sewell and Cottrell in statements and interviews with Reuters and other media, also said they were appalled by the attacks on the mosques. 
"Politically motivated violence is not in the interest of our organization or our community," Sewell said in his since-deleted Facebook statement on March 20.
In his interview with Reuters, Sewell said further that Tarrant's violence had caused governments to become "extremely reactionary", passing legislation "without thinking it through".
New Zealand moved swiftly to ban the kinds of semi-automatic weapons used in the attacks. 
"We have a new level of totalitarian thought crime legislation across New Zealand and shortly here in Australia too," Sewell added.

Here’s your checklist of everything to know in business and tech for the coming week, so you can feel up-to-date and well-rounded even if all you want to talk about is Meghan Markle’s baby. (Any day now!) Enjoy the rest of your weekend.
MARCH 24-30 
Eight members of the Sackler family, owners of the pharmaceutical company that makes the potent (and highly addictive) opioid OxyContin, have been sued for fraud by New York State. They are accused of hiding profits and siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars from their company, Purdue Pharma, into personal offshore accounts while the business was under investigation for its role in stoking the opioid epidemic. Since OxyContin came on the market in 1996, more than 200,000 people in the United States have died from overdoses involving prescription opioids, and the Sacklers have become one of the country’s wealthiest families. 
If you take a Lyft this week, pay attention — does it feel any different to use the world’s first publicly traded ride-hailing platform? Perhaps not, but at least you’re both going places. The company made its market debut on Friday, hitting the Nasdaq with much fanfare at $72 a share. It finished its first day of trading at $78.29 (putting its value at more than $26.4 billion), and its Silicon Valley brethren will be closely watching its progress. A wave of other big tech start-ups — known as “unicorns” once they cross the threshold of a $1 billion dollar valuation, although these are now technically “decacorns” — plan to follow in Lyft’s footsteps later this year, including Uber (Lyft’s bigger competitor), Slack, Pinterest and Postmates. 
Apple is turning over a new leaf — or several. The tech company plans this fall to start streaming original programming and shows from partnering networks on an app called Apple TV Plus, intended to rival Netflix and HBO. It’s also rolling out a news service that charges users $10 a month to access over 300 different publications, some of which charge subscription fees otherwise. Plus, it’s introducing more games. And — why not? — a credit card with Goldman Sachs. It’s all part of a larger plan to diversify beyond hardware products like iPhones, which haven’t been bringing in as much revenue lately. 
MARCH 31-APRIL 6
What’s to become of Brexit? As its original deadline of March 29 came and went, Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union is a bigger mess than ever. The British Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s last-ditch effort to pass her plan on Friday, even when she played her final bargaining chip — her own seat, which she offered to give up if opposing lawmakers would agree to the deal. That wasn’t enough. Now, Britain is lurching toward a potential “no-deal” Brexit on April 12. That could have catastrophic consequences for its economy and send shock waves through Europe and beyond. 
Look out for more definitive news about what may have caused the two deadly Boeing 737 Max plane crashes, and what Boeing and the Federal Aviation Authority plan to do about it. Investigators reached a preliminary conclusion on Thursday that a glitchy system kicked in right before the Ethiopian Airlines flight went down earlier this month. Boeing has proposed updating the software and making other changes to the planes, which have been grounded for more than two weeks. The fixes would give pilots more control over the flight system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data. Boeing didn’t provide a timeline for carrying out the fixes, since it needs the F.A.A. — also under intense scrutiny over its certification of the jet — to give its blessing first. 
If you’re sick of the trade war between the United States and China, imagine how the negotiators on both sides feel at this point. Chinese officials will fly back to Washington this week to continue talks, just days after American representatives visited Beijing. But the needle is moving on one major sticking point: intellectual property. American companies have complained of pressure to share their proprietary technology as a condition of working with Chinese business partners, only to see that technology adopted by Chinese competitors. As part of a trade deal, the United States wants to put a lid on this practice, and officials say that progress is finally being made. 
Facebook has been accused of causing housing discrimination by allowing advertisers to target ads on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin. Separately, the platform announced a ban on all white nationalist content after a New Zealand gunman used social media to post live video of his attacks on two mosques. In other news, Wow Air, an Icelandic budget airline, ceased operations with no warning on Thursday, leaving passengers stranded. And speaking of dud flights: The first all-female spacewalk was canceled when astronauts couldn’t find spacesuits to fit them at the International Space Station.

News Analysis
By Damien Cave
SYDNEY, Australia — What if live-streaming required a government permit, and videos could only be broadcast online after a seven-second delay?
What if Facebook, YouTube and Twitter were treated like traditional publishers, expected to vet every post, comment and image before they reached the public? Or like Boeing or Toyota, held responsible for the safety of their products and the harm they cause?
Imagine what the internet would look like if tech executives could be jailed for failing to censor hate and violence.
These are the kinds of proposals under discussion in Australia and New Zealand as politicians in both nations move to address popular outrage over the massacre this month of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand. The gunman, believed to be an Australian white nationalist, distributed a manifesto online before streaming part of the mass shootings on Facebook.
If the two countries move ahead, it could be a watershed moment for the era of global social media. No established democracies have ever come as close to applying such sweeping restrictions on online communication, and the demand for change has both harnessed and amplified rising global frustration with an industry that is still almost entirely shaped by American law and Silicon Valley’s libertarian norms.
“Big social media companies have a responsibility to take every possible action to ensure their technology products are not exploited by murderous terrorists,” Scott Morrison, Australia’s prime minister, said Saturday. “It should not just be a matter of just doing the right thing. It should be the law.”
The push for government intervention — with a bill to be introduced in Australia this week — reflects a surge of anger in countries more open to restrictions on speech than in the United States, and growing impatience with distant companies seen as more worried about their business models than local concerns.
There are precedents for the kinds of regulations under consideration. At one end of the spectrum is China, where the world’s most sophisticated system of internet censorship stifles almost all political debate along with hate speech and pornography — but without preventing the rise of homegrown tech companies making sizable profits.
No one in Australia or New Zealand is suggesting that should be the model. But the other end of the spectrum — the 24/7 bazaar of instant user-generated content — also looks increasingly unacceptable to people in this part of the world.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand argues that there must be a middle ground, and that some kind of international consensus is needed to keep the platforms from limiting public protection only to certain countries.
“Ultimately, we can all promote good rules locally, but these platforms are global,” she said Thursday.
Even in the United States, frustration has been building as studies show that social media’s algorithms and design push people further into extremism even as the platforms are protected by the Communications Decency Act, which shields them from liability for the content they host.
Some social media companies are starting to say they are willing to accept more oversight and guidance.
In an op-ed in The Washington Post on Saturday, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, called for government help with setting ground rules for harmful online content, election integrity, privacy and data portability.
“It’s impossible to remove all harmful content from the internet, but when people use dozens of different sharing services — all with their own policies and processes — we need a more standardized approach,” he wrote.
At the same time, Facebook and the other major platforms insist they are doing everything they can on their own with a mix of artificial intelligence and moderators.
Google, the parent company of YouTube — which declined to comment on the proposals in Australia and New Zealand — has hired 10,000 reviewers to flag controversial content for removal. Facebook, too, has said it will hire tens of thousands more employees to deal with finding and removing content that violates its rules.
Those rules may be getting tougher. On Wednesday, Facebook announced that it would ban white nationalist content because “white nationalism and separatism cannot be meaningfully separated from white supremacy and organized hate groups.”
But critics say it’s too little, too late.
Facebook has “been on notice for some time that their policies and enforcement in this area were ineffective,” David Shanks, New Zealand’s chief censor, said in an email on Sunday. Since the mosque killings in Christchurch, Mr. Shanks has made it a crime to possess or distribute the video of the attack and the suspect’s manifesto.
Experts say social media companies still take as a given that users should be allowed to post material without advance vetting. Neither the communications laws that govern broadcast nor the ratings systems applied to movies and video games affect social media, leaving a frictionless, ad-driven business model built to encourage as much content creation (and consumption) as possible.
From a business perspective, the system works. On YouTube, 500 hours of video are uploaded every minute. In 2016, Facebook said viewers watched 100 million hours of video every day, while Twitter handles 500 million tweets a day, or nearly 6,000 every second.
“The more speech there is on these platforms, the more money they can make,” said Rebecca Lewis, a doctoral student at Stanford and researcher at Data & Society who has studied radicalization patterns on YouTube. “More speech is more profit.”
Europe is already trying to rein in the free-for-all. On Tuesday, the European Parliament passed a law that will make companies liable for uploaded content that violates copyright. It follows a tough privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, and an online hate speech law in Germany, the Network Enforcement Act, both of which took effect last year.
The laws represent a significant setback for social media behemoths that have long argued that their platforms should be treated as neutral gathering places rather than arbiters of content.

The hate speech law in particular is being closely studied in New Zealand and Australia.
It tries to hold platforms liable for not deleting content that is “evidently illegal” in Germany, including child pornography and Nazi propaganda and memorabilia. Companies that systematically fail to remove illegal content within 24 hours face fines of up to 50 million euros, or around $56 million.
Australian officials said Saturday that they were also planning hefty fines.
And yet, it is far from clear that stiffer penalties alone are the solution.
One problem, according to experts, is that banned posts, photos and videos continue to linger online. The mix of human moderation and artificial intelligence that platforms have deployed thus far has not been enough to monitor and drain the swamp of toxic content.
“The automation is just not as advanced as these governments hope they are,” said Robyn Caplan, a researcher at Data & Society and a doctoral candidate at Rutgers University.
“It’s a mistake,” she added, “to call these things ‘artificial intelligence,’ because it makes us think they are a lot smarter than they are.”
At the same time, legitimate expressions of opinion, including a satirical magazine, have been deleted because of the law.
“We have to be incredibly careful and nuanced when we draw these lines,” Ms. Caplan said.
Even the criticism of live-streaming — which Facebook has said it is taking seriously — needs to be carefully considered, she added, because “there’s a lot of good coming out of live-streaming,” including transparency and scrutiny of the police.
Officials in Australia and New Zealand are trying to work through these issues. After meeting last week with executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter, Australian lawmakers said Saturday that the new bill would make it a criminal offense punishable by three years in prison for social media platforms not to “remove abhorrent violent material expeditiously.”
They made it clear that the tech world’s self-image of exceptionalism needed to end.
“Mainstream media that broadcast such material would be putting their license at risk, and there is no reason why social media platforms should be treated any differently,” Attorney General Christian Porter said.
John Edwards, New Zealand’s privacy commissioner, agreed but pointed to a different example: the Boeing 737 Max plane that has been grounded worldwide after two crashes believed to be tied to a software problem.
“I would say Facebook’s ability to moderate harmful content on its live-streaming service represents a software problem that means the service should be suspended,” he said. “I think that’s just the right thing to do.”

MANILA — A bomb exploded at a restaurant in the southern Philippines on Wednesday, wounding at least 18 people in a suspected revenge attack by a militant group, security officials said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast in the mostly Christian city of Isulan on the southern island of Mindanao, a region troubled by banditry and armed rebellions.
The bombing was suspected to be in retaliation for the killing of Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), a pro-Islamic State group, by government troops, Major General Cirilito Sobejana said.
"This could be an effort to avenge their losses. We have neutralized many of their members in our relentless operations," Sobejana told reporters.
Another possible motive for the attack was an extortion letter sent to the restaurant owner last week, he said. 
Government forces have in recent months pursued members of the small pro-Islamic state militant group in central Mindanao. The BIFF was blamed for a blast in August and another bombing in September in Isulan that killed five people and wounded dozens.
Islamist militants operate in the south of the largely Christian country and some are known to have links with groups abroad, including al Qaeda and Islamic State.

CANBERRA — Australia will fine social media companies up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover and imprison executives for up to three years if violent content is not removed "expeditiously" under a new law passed by the country's parliament on Thursday.
The new law is in response to a lone gunman attack on two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, killing 50 people as they attended Friday prayers.
The gunman broadcasted his attack live on Facebook and it was widely shared for over an hour before being removed, a timeframe Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison described as unacceptable.
Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with one murder following the attack and was remanded without a plea. He is due back in court on April 5, when police said he was likely to face more charges.
It is now an offense in Australia for companies, such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet's Google, which owns YouTube, not to remove any videos or photographs that show murder, torture or rape without delay. 
Companies must also inform Australian police within a "reasonable" timeframe.
"It is important that we make a very clear statement to social media companies that we expect their behavior to change," Mitch Fifield, Australia's minister for communications and the arts, told reporters in Canberra.
Juries will decide whether companies have complied with the timetable.
"We have zero tolerance for terrorist content on our platforms," said a spokesperson for Google in an emailed statement.
"We are committed to leading the way in developing new technologies and standards for identifying and removing terrorist content."
A spokeswoman for Facebook was not immediately able for comment.
Facebook said last week it was exploring restrictions on who can access their live video-streaming service, depending on factors such as previous violations of the site's community standards.
Australia's opposition Labor party backed the legislation, but said it will consult with the technology industry over possible amendments if it wins power at an election due in May. 
Australia's parliament will rise until after the election. The newly elected lawmakers will not sit until at least July.
Critics of the legislation said the government moved too quickly, without proper consultation and consideration.
"Laws formulated as a knee-jerk reaction to a tragic event do not necessarily equate to good legislation and can have myriad unintended consequences," said Arthur Moses, head of the Australian Law Council.

CANBERRA, Australia — An Australian senator was censured by his colleagues on Wednesday for seeking to blame the victims of last month's mosque shootings and vilify Muslims.
Sen. Fraser Anning was the target of widespread condemnation for blaming the attack in New Zealand on immigration policies. He faced more criticism later for physically striking a teenager who cracked a raw egg on his head in a viral incident in Melbourne.
On Parliament's second sitting day since the March 15 attack in which 50 people died, government and opposition lawmakers moved the censure motion against Anning for divisive comments "seeking to attribute blame to victims of a horrific crime and to vilify people on the basis of religion, which do not reflect the opinions of the Australian Senate or the Australian people."
"Sen. Anning's comments were ugly and divisive. They were dangerous and unacceptable from anyone, let alone a member of this place," Government Senate Leader Mathias Cormann told the Senate.
Anning dismissed the censure motion as an attack on free speech. "It is also an exercise in left-wing virtue signaling of the worst kind," he told the Senate before the vote.
He sits as an independent lawmaker after defecting from the anti-Muslim One Nation party, whose two senators abstained from the censure vote.
One Nation Sen. Peter Georgiou read a speech on behalf of party leader Pauline Hanson, who was absent.
Hanson said while Anning's comments were "untimely and therefore deemed highly insensitive, he still maintains a right to his opinion."
"If One Nation endorses your action to censure Sen. Anning, your freedom of speech as elected members of this chamber will be removed," the speech said.
A day after the Christchurch attacks, Anning faced more criticism for physically striking the teenager who cracked an egg on his head at a Melbourne public appearance — 17-year-old Will Connolly, who became known around the world as "Egg Boy."
Anning on Wednesday criticized Prime Minister Scott Morrison for saying at the time that Anning should "be subject to the full force of the law" for his retaliation against Connolly. Police investigated the altercation but no charges have been announced.
"It might have only been an idiot with an egg this time, but there is a continuum that begins with this and ends with a fanatic with a gun or a bomb," Anning said.
"But apparently, according to Prime Minister Morrison, that's OK, as long as the victims are conservatives," he added.
The minor Greens party later failed to win majority support for a motion for the Senate to suspend Anning.
Mehreen Faruqi, a Pakistan-born Greens senator, produced an online petition to the Senate with more than 1.4 million signatures calling for Anning to resign.
She argued that he should be suspended as well as censured.
"It is terrifying that rightwing extremist groups have a found a mouthpiece in Federal Parliament," Faruqi told the Senate.
An Irish-born lawmaker who criticized British policy toward his homeland in 1920 became the only Australian legislator to be expelled from Parliament by a vote of colleagues.
Senate President Scott Ryan warned that laws had been tightened in the 1980s so that suspending Anning could be challenged in the courts.
After New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern previously called Anning's comments on the shootings "a disgrace," her deputy Winston Peters on Tuesday called Anning a "jingoistic moron."
Anning came under blistering criticism over tweets within hours of the massacre, including one that said, "Does anyone still dispute the link between Muslim immigration and violence?"
"The real cause of the bloodshed on New Zealand streets today is the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand in the first place," he said in a later statement.
Australian white supremacist Brenton Tarrant has been charged with murder in the shootings and is due to appear in a New Zealand court on Friday.

HERAT, Afghanistan — Hundreds of Taliban fighters stormed a district in Afghanistan's western Badghis province, with both Afghan government forces and the insurgent group suffering dozens of casualties, provincial officials said.
The district of Bala Murghab has been a recurring hotspot of fighting in the past two months, and officials have previously warned that it could fall to the Taliban without reinforcements.
Fighting in Afghanistan has escalated ahead of the usual spring season, as both sides seek to increase leverage in talks on a peace settlement. 
The Taliban killed 36 members of the government forces and captured several security checkpoints in attacks that began on Wednesday night, Waris Sherzad, district governor of Bala Murghab, said late on Thursday. Fighting was ongoing, he said.
More than 30 Taliban were also killed, said Jamshed Shahabi spokesman for Badghis' provincial governor. 
Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said it attacked from four directions, capturing five checkpoints. 
Afghanistan's defense ministry, in a series of tweets, said its forces chose to "tactically retreat" from the checkpoints to prevent civilian casualties. The ministry said it called in multiple air strikes on Taliban positions.
On Friday, the defense ministry said Afghan forces had forced the Taliban to retreat from some checkpoints and that all key areas remained under its control
The conflict in Badghis has been particularly intense along with northern Kunduz province and Helmand province in the south in recent weeks. Both sides took heavy casualties in Badghis last month, and at one point 50 members of Afghan security forces surrendered to the Taliban.
Fighting between militant groups has also intensified. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement on Thursday that Islamic State attacks on Taliban positions on March 23 resulted in 21,000 people being displaced in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces. 
The latest round of peace talks between U.S. and Taliban officials wrapped up last month, with both sides citing progress.
Meanwhile, severe flooding hit Badghis province on Thursday, killing an unknown number of people and sweeping away houses, farmland and schools, aid organization World Vision said. 
The floods took Afghans by surprise, coming about a week after previous floods, and were triggered by only moderate rains, the organization said in a statement. 
The country has little infrastructure, such as ditches and sewers, to manage water run-off.
World Vision added that it does not yet have an estimate of the number of people affected.

CANBERRA — Australia will fine social media and web hosting companies up to 10 percent of their annual global turnover and imprison executives for up to three years if violent content is not removed "expeditiously" under a new law.

Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a suspected white supremacist, was charged with one murder following the attack and was remanded without a plea.
New Zealand police said on Thursday that Tarrant will face a total of 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges when he appears in court on Friday.
Under the new laws, it is now an offence in Australia for companies, such as Facebook Inc and Alphabet's Google, which owns YouTube, not to remove any videos or photographs that show murder, torture or rape without delay.

"It is important that we make a very clear statement to social media companies that we expect their behavior to change," Australian Minister for Communications and the Arts Mitch Fifield told reporters in Canberra.
Australian Attorney-General Christian Porter described the laws as a "world first in terms of legislating the conduct of social media and online platforms".
Juries will decide whether companies have complied with the timetable, heightening the risk of high-profile convictions.
"Whenever there are juries involved, they can get it wrong but when you add into the mix technology - which is complex - the risk is heightened," Jason Bosland, professor of media law, University of Melbourne told Reuters.
Technology firms said they are already working on the issue.
"We have zero tolerance for terrorist content on our platforms," said a spokesperson for Google in an emailed statement.
"We are committed to leading the way in developing new technologies and standards for identifying and removing terrorist content."
A spokeswoman for Facebook was not immediately available for comment.
Facebook said last week it was exploring restrictions on who can access their live video-streaming service, depending on factors such as previous violations of the site's community standards.
Digital Industry Group Inc (DIGI) - of which Facebook, Apple, Google, Amazon and Twitter are members - said the laws fail to understand the complexity of removing violent content.
"With the vast volumes of content uploaded to the internet every second, this is a highly complex problem," said Sunita Bose, Managing Director of DIGI. 
Australia's opposition Labor party backed the legislation, but said it will consult with the technology industry over possible amendments if it wins power at an election due in May.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.
A year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.
The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.
But critics saw few systemic changes.
“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.
A history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.
“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”
And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.
Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.
Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)
More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.
His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.
“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.
Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.
While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.
“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”
Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.
Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.
That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.
Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)
“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.
Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.
Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.
“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.
To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”
“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”
Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”
Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.
“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”
Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”

The right bra can beat bounce and end chafing — and it might change the way you work out.
By Anna Perling
Ms. Perling is a staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company.
At 12 years old, Holly Powell quit the swim team when her breasts outgrew her swimsuit. In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”
When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”
Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. 
Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).
In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).
The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)
Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”
When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.
Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.
After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.
Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.
Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.
Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.
Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.
Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.
Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.
Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.
If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).
Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.

The sports radio personality Craig Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Friday by a longtime fan and listener — the judge — for a ticket reselling scheme that ended his broadcast partnership with the former N.F.L. quarterback Boomer Esiason.
Carton, convicted in November of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud, was sentenced by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court.
She greeted him like a radio listener.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Carton. Colleen from New York. First time, long time,” the judge said, adding that she used to listen to his show as she drove to court.
“I knew you could be fun to listen to,” she said. “I also knew you could be a jerk.”
The prison term was half of what prosecutors sought after Carton was convicted at a November trial of soliciting and then largely gambling away nearly $7 million.
Geoffrey S. Berman, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a release that Carton’s ticket resale business, which purported to use his connections to obtain good seats for events like Metallica and Barbra Streisand concerts, was an “elaborate fiction.”
Carton, a 50-year-old Manhattan resident, blamed his fall from a measure of celebrity and wealth on “wildly stupid decisions” he made as he tried to cope with memories of being sexually abused at age 11.
He said memories of the abuse were set off by revelations of the crimes of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State football assistant who was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2012. That led him first to speak angrily and more emotionally than he ever had before on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton” show, which he co-hosted for years with Esiason. Then he could not sleep.
“Nobody knows what it’s like when lights go out and you lay in bed awake and the demons come,” Carton said.
He recalled turning to blackjack and eventually developing a gambling addiction so serious that winning and losing became irrelevant.
Carton said his arrest in 2017 was a “lightning bolt of awareness for me.” He said he had joined Gamblers Anonymous and was undergoing therapy.
“I am truly powerless over this disease,” Carton said. His last bet — a loss — came in June, he added.
Before describing the sentence, the judge said she had enjoyed Carton’s show, except when it became too “raunchy.”
But she likened his crimes to those of the financier Bernard L. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence, though she said Madoff’s scheme, in which he squandered roughly $20 billion, went on far longer.
The judge dismissed Carton’s claims that he never meant to lose investors’ money, saying it was a common justification in financial crimes.
“The money always runs out at some point, and only then do you realize the road to your personal hell was truly paved with your good intentions,” she said.
“Craig Carton, you have indeed descended into a hell of your own making,” the judge said. “Everything you spent a lifetime of building up is gone. Your marriage is over. Your family is decimated. Your kids are terrified. Your career is in tatters. Your reputation is lost.”
She did, however, praise Carton’s plan to publicly urge others to stop gambling as she ordered him to pay $4.8 million in restitution and to forfeit $4.2 million. He also must do 150 hours of community service.
She said Carton could perhaps someday resume a radio show, which he left after his arrest, but she noted one of the biggest advertisers on sports radio shows seemed to be legal gambling businesses.
“That troubles me,” the judge said.
Carton must report to prison on July 15.

INDIANAPOLIS — NBC Sports will use retired NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. in its inaugural broadcast of the Indianapolis 500 next month.
The second-year analyst will be part of a team that features 14 commentators and host Mike Tirico and analyst Danica Patrick.
Earnhardt will be a roving reporter for his first Indianapolis 500 on May 26, contributing to pre-race, in-race and post-race coverage alongside Rutledge Wood. Earnhardt Jr., who will also be featured from Indianapolis Motor Speedway during race week, was used extensively by the network in his first year after retirement with reporting trips to last year's Winter Olympics in South Korea and the Super Bowl.
NBC Sports motorsports host Krista Voda will also join Earnhardt at Indianapolis.
The broadcast booth will be NBC Sports' full-time IndyCar crew of play-by-play announcer Leigh Diffey and analysts Paul Tracy and Townsend Bell. The 14 total commentators will be the most ever for NBC Sports' coverage of IndyCar as the network plans to treat the Indy 500 as one of its showcase events. ABC had broadcast the "Greatest Spectacle in Racing" exclusively since 1965 in the second-longest-running partnership of its kind until NBC purchased the rights to air the entire 2019 IndyCar schedule.
Marty Snider, Kelli Stavast, Kevin Lee and Jon Beekhuis will be the pit reporters for the Indy 500, along with reporters Robin Miller and Dillon Welch.

(Reuters) - Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight Artem Lobov, a long-time friend and team mate of Conor McGregor, is set to make a lucrative debut in bare-knuckle boxing as combat sports bid to gain more mainstream acceptance. 
Nicknamed the "Russian Hammer", Lobov told Reuters he had accepted a big payday from the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship to fight another UFC veteran, Jason Knight, on a pay-per-view card in Biloxi, Mississippi on Saturday. 
"I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse," he said during a stopover in New York. 
Long considered the only realistic professional alternative outside of boxing for combat sports athletes, the UFC is now competing with other mixed martial arts and grappling promotions. 
European and Asian promotions are attracting sellout crowds, and the Bellator organization recently signed a large number of British and Irish prospects to try to make inroads in Europe. 
They were also on the trail of Lobov when he was released from the UFC in January.
"They made a very nice offer, a lot more than I was getting in the UFC, but it did not match the offer that Bare Knuckle made. With Bare Knuckle, I can also accept other offers as long as it doesn't interfere with their schedule, so it's a win-win for me," the 32-year-old said. 
"I get to go in, fight bare-knuckle, make a lot of money, hopefully build a better name for myself and then see what else is out there."
FRONT FOOT
Though he has a losing professional record of 14 wins and 15 losses, Lobov is hugely popular with fans due to his fearless style of fighting off his front foot and his toughness, with 12 of his MMA losses coming by decision. 
Lobov brushes aside the suggestion that bare-knuckle boxing is more primitive than MMA. 
"It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times," he said. "In that sense, it's nothing.
"I truly, truly love fighting, so that's not an issue for me. It's like saying to a swimmer, 'Do you mind getting wet?' Of course not, he's a swimmer," he said. 
Lobov credits Irishman McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, with bringing combat sports into the mainstream in the U.S. and enabling him and many others to make a living as fighters. 
"In many ways it is thanks to Conor, for sure, and it's definitely a lot better than before, but the best times are still ahead of us," Lobov said. 
"Ten years ago I fought a top-10 European fighter on four days' notice for 400 pounds, and to go from that to where I am now, earning six figures for a fight? Certainly, I see the improvements in the sport."
Though delighted to have a chance to test his boxing without the threat of kicks or takedowns, Lobov will be back in the MMA cage soon. 
"I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge. I'm still grappling, I'm still wrestling and doing everything," he said. 
"I want to improve and to achieve many, many things in MMA, boxing and bare-knuckle boxing."

COPENHAGEN — The squats and leg lifts were harder than they looked, and after a few sets, Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez placed his hands on his knees and attempted to compose himself.
In November, Aguirre, a 24-year-old professional video game player from Spain, joined the five-man roster of Origen, a League of Legends team that competes in the game’s top European league. The players — all signed in late fall — were told at the time that the team might be run a bit differently from what they were accustomed to. Now here they were, five young men who make their living sitting almost completely still in front of desktop computers, sweating through an hourlong workout in a cramped gym.
“I think I’m going to puke my oatmeal,” said Aguirre, who is known in the gaming community as Mithy. “I’m dying.”
Some years ago, traditional sports leagues were revolutionized by young analysts wielding computers. The way things had always been done, it turned out, was not always the best way to do things. Now echoes of that transformation have arrived in the growing world of professional e-sports, where gamers are being shepherded toward a new frontier, oddly, by the old, corporeal wisdom of traditional sports.
The debate about whether competitive gamers can be considered athletes may never end. In the meantime, though, gamers are increasingly acting like them.
Origen is one of two teams owned by Rfrsh Entertainment, an e-sports company based in Copenhagen. Two years ago, the organization hired Kasper Hvidt, a former captain of Denmark’s national handball team, to be its sporting director. Hvidt, 43, had no previous exposure to gaming. But that was the point.
E-sports in recent years have crept into the mainstream, attracting new fans, new sponsors and new investment. The top professionals now make six-figure salaries and earn even more with endorsements and prize money. And yet, Hvidt observed, their approach to performance remained amateurish.
Eating right, sleeping right, exercising, cleaning up for sponsors — these ideas have undergirded traditional sports for generations. In e-sports, they are regarded as almost radical.
“They don’t look at themselves as physical human beings,” said Hvidt, who won the European handball championship with Denmark in 2008.
“It’s common sense, in a way. But with them it was not.”
Rfrsh has a validating narrative under its belt. The company’s other team, Astralis, which competes internationally in the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had gone almost a year without winning a tournament when Hvidt joined the organization in mid-2017. In 2018, the team earned $3.7 million in prize money while putting together one of the most dominant years ever by any team in any e-sports game.
And so Origen this year has set off on the same journey of athletic self-improvement. As recently as last year, the players’ typical day might have been a sedentary extravaganza of sugary energy drinks, fast food and unresolved psychic tension. Now, their days are interposed with protein smoothies, yoga mats and slow-paced breathing exercises.
The effects of those changes, the team said, have been plain to see: After starting the current season with a 1-4 record, Origen went on a tear, winning 11 of its final 13 matches, finishing the regular season in second place and securing a first-round bye for the playoffs, which began Friday.
“These are little things,” Fabian Broich, Origen’s assistant coach, said. “But they add up, and over the long term you have a more emotionally stable team and a more focused team.”
At Rfrsh, Hvidt has assembled a performance team — a physical trainer, a sports psychologist, a massage therapist, a medical doctor and a nutritionist — and constructed a lifestyle plan for the players that combines scientific research, old-school sports wisdom and simple common sense. Broich, 28, a former professional soccer player from Germany, acts as a liaison between the management team and the players, implementing the principles on the ground.
The players, who hail from five European countries and range in age from 18 to 24, live in Denmark and fly each weekend to Berlin, where the League of Legends matches are taped in front of a boisterous studio audience. In Copenhagen, they are required to get around by bicycle (a rule they all hated at first) and have fitness and yoga classes during the week. On Mondays, they meet with the team psychologist for an “empty-the-backpack” session.
Every morning, the team meets for breakfast in Broich’s apartment, a ritual designed in part to get the gamers — night owls and notoriously late risers — out of bed at a reasonable hour. Their other meals are catered with guidance from the nutritionist.
“Before, I would go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. the next day, eat McDonald’s two times, and that’d be it,” Patrik Jiru, 18, an Origen player from the Czech Republic, said as he ate a salmon and vegetable omelet one recent morning.
After breakfast, the players biked to the gym for a core workout and a physical therapy session.
“Last time we did this, my body was sore for three days,” Jonas Andersen, 24, an Origen player from Denmark known as Kold, said as he grabbed a medicine ball.
Mikkel Hjuler, a trainer who works with Danish Olympians, guided the team through some gaming-specific exercises. He had the players wrap their fists inside elastic bands and flex their fingers. He taught them a neck exercise favored by boxers.
The players were willing participants, but they admitted that their ambitions, from a physical standpoint, were modest.
“I’m O.K. with being chubby as long as I don’t pass out when I’m running — which, right now, I might,” Aguirre said.
The players continue to train several hours a day in front of computers, but even those sessions now borrow elements from traditional sports.
Before a recent scrimmage session at the Rfrsh headquarters, Broich distributed magnesium pills and protein bars. (He keeps vitamin D and krill oil in his arsenal, too.) Later, he blended a potpourri of nutritional supplements — moringa, matcha, maca, chlorella, açaí and a half-dozen others — into a thick protein shake.
In their meeting room, a quotation attributed to the N.B.A. coach Phil Jackson — “The strength of the team is each individual member” — was scribbled on a dry-erase board. After one practice game, the team laid out yoga mats and stretched on foam rollers.
Trevor Henry, 31, a broadcast commentator for Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, marveled at how quickly the game’s competitive landscape was professionalizing. He was happy, for instance, that some teams were reconsidering their use of gaming houses, a classic e-sports setup in which players live and train together under one roof.
“Go back just a few years: Professional players would play 10 to 11 hours every day and do takeout food every day,” Henry said. “Pizza boxes would stack up rooms. Laundry would never get done. I’ll be brutally honest: Teams didn’t wash the team shirts. They’d have the same team shirt that they’d wear 24 weeks in a year that has never seen detergent.”
This lifestyle — part monk, part fraternity brother — was not only accepted but also held up as the very reason the players were successful. But that wisdom is now being challenged, and in Europe the shift by League of Legends this year to a 10-team, franchise model (akin to American sports leagues) has encouraged organizations to make more long-term investments.
Last year, Fabien Devide, the chairman of Team Vitality, a French gaming organization, spent seven months embedded in his League of Legends team’s gaming house in Berlin. He was startled by what he saw.
“It was a madhouse,” Devide said, describing an atmosphere with an utter lack of boundaries between personal and professional life. “It can become a toxic environment very quick.”
Devide said Team Vitality planned to move its players into separate apartments later this year. Acknowledging the pioneering example of Rfrsh, he said he was formalizing plans to open a training center for his organization in Paris and hire a performance director, in the mold of Hvidt, to devise a program grounded in traditional sports ideas.
Teams now understand that championships are won and lost in the details. When Origen was assembling its squad last year, Hvidt asked potential signees to complete a personality test with hundreds of questions to make sure it was building an emotionally compatible group.
In December, the players convened for a preseason camp with one catch: no computers. Instead, the players spent several days completing trust exercises and discussing their dreams with Lars Robl, a sports psychologist who spent two decades in the Danish special forces — “the real Counter Strike,” he joked — and whose other clients include the Danish soccer club F.C. Midtjylland.
Robl’s job now is to help the gamers see themselves as elite athletes, just like the soccer players.
“They have the same DNA,” Robl said. “They’re just not aware of it yet.”

Miguel Andujar, the Yankees third baseman, listened to the gently phrased questions about his injured right shoulder and the possibility of having season-ending surgery. He acknowledged the cold truths about torn labra: They can’t heal on their own, and most players who suffer similar ruptures end up on the operating table.
Yes, Andujar said, he gets that. But as he spoke before the Yankees’ 3-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday, Andujar dismissed the worst-case scenario, vowing to beat the odds, avoid surgery and return to action within weeks.
If he does so, it would be a rare instance of good fortune for the Yankees, who now have eight players on the 10-day Injured List, including their ace (Luis Severino), circus strong man and home run leader (Giancarlo Stanton), and their front-line shortstop (Didi Gregorius). Andujar joined them after a headfirst dive into third base against the Orioles on Sunday.
After initially feeling a “weird” sensation in his shoulder, Andujar said, he remained in the game, and he still felt strong afterward and even into Monday. But a magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed a small labral tear, prompting the Yankees to shut Andujar down for at least two weeks. After that, he will begin a cautious program of physical therapy, which he and the team hope will preclude the need for surgery.
“I’m optimistic,” Andujar said. “My shoulder is strong. There’s a still a chance I can get through this and get back on the field.”
Aaron Boone was just as inclined to turn his gaze away from the possibility of an Andujar-less summer. Hard to blame him: The 24-year-old infielder finished second in the American League’s rookie of the year voting in 2018, leading all first-year players in hits (170) and breaking the Yankees’ record for doubles in a rookie season — previously set by Joe DiMaggio in 1936.
Although inconsistent on defense — he committed 15 errors last year — Andujar’s performance partly explained the Yankees’ decision to pass on pursuing Manny Machado in free agency this winter. After losing to the Red Sox in a division series, the Yankees were decidedly upbeat about Andujar and their roster in general entering 2019.
That optimism was based on three factors: that Aaron Judge, who missed seven weeks with a broken wrist last summer, would be healthy in 2019; that Stanton would be better acclimated to playing in the high-pressure New York market in his second year; and that catcher Gary Sanchez had nowhere to go but up after batting a disastrous .186 last season.
Bundled with the continued maturation of Andujar and his fellow rookie Gleyber Torres, the Yankees felt they could close the gap on Boston without spending much on new additions. Judge spoke for his teammates recently when he said, “From the first day in camp, I felt this was going to be a better team than last year.”
But five games in, it has been a harsh reality for the Yankees, who have yet to gain traction on the season despite starting off against two lightly regarded opponents, the Orioles and Tigers. An unusually severe run of injuries has only compounded their frustration.
Severino, who received a diagnosis of shoulder inflammation last month, still has not thrown off a mound, and he is not likely to return until May at the earliest. Center fielder Aaron Hicks is battling a stubborn lower back problem; he has already received two cortisone shots. Dellin Betances, the flame-throwing reliever, is sidelined with a shoulder impingement, although he threw a bullpen session on Tuesday and could be back in a week.
Stanton’s injury was the most mysterious: a grade-1 strain of his left biceps he sustained with what Boone called a “funky” swing on Sunday. Like Andujar, Stanton will be out of the lineup for at least 10 days, although his injury is less serious. Nevertheless, the Yankees have been forced to depend on reinforcements earlier than expected, putting their depth — and emotional resilience — to the test.
The always-upbeat Boone said he felt the Yankees would emerge as a better team after April’s challenges.
“One of the strengths of our organization is the depth,” he said, adding that each of the Yankees’ replacements were “capable of producing at the big league level.”
Boone’s rallying cry might have resonated a bit more had the Yankees not lost their opening series to the Orioles. Most damning was their situational hitting: The Yankees went 10 for 56 with runners on base in the three-game series, including 6 for 29 (.207) with men in scoring position, including eight strikeouts.
There wasn’t much improvement on Tuesday, when the Yankees managed just six hits against the Tigers and didn’t have a runner in scoring position over the final four innings.
Starter Masahiro Tanaka threw effectively for 6⅔ innings, but his work was undone by closer Aroldis Chapman, who continues to lose velocity.
As Chapman allowed the deciding two runs in the ninth inning, his once-feared 100-miles-per-hour fastball ticked down as low as 95.
“I feel great,” he said despite allowing four of the seven batters he faced to reach base, dooming the Yankees to another loss.
First baseman Luke Voit asked for patience from unsettled fans, saying: “It’s super early. There are still 157 games to go.”
But a different crew will have to right the ship.
Without Andujar and Stanton, call-ups like Clint Frazier and Tyler Wade will get their chance. D.J. LeMahieu, the infielder acquired by the Yankees in January, started in place of Andujar on Tuesday.
But will it be the same Yankees? Boone insisted that his “expectations have not changed,” although no one could blame him for crossing his fingers — tightly.

A rough start to the 2019 season got significantly worse for the Yankees on Monday. In a surprising announcement in the morning, the already-bruised Yankees placed their star outfielder Giancarlo Stanton on the injured list with a left biceps strain. Then, 30 minutes before the start of a 3-1 win over the Detroit Tigers on Monday night, the team announced that third baseman Miguel Andujar had joined the list with a right shoulder injury that might require a season-ending operation.
Stanton, a crucial power hitter, and Andujar, the American League rookie of the year runner-up last season, exhibited no obvious signs of injury during a season-opening series loss to the lowly Baltimore Orioles.
Andujar, 24, hurt his shoulder while sliding back into third base in the fourth inning of Sunday’s 7-5 loss to the Orioles. But he finished the game, reporting no problems. Scheduled to be off on Monday, he visited the trainer’s room to have the shoulder checked and then was sent for a magnetic resonance imaging exam, which revealed a torn labrum.
Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said the team would try therapy for Andujar and then re-evaluate his shoulder in a couple of weeks to see if surgery seemed necessary.
“His physical test with the doctor is really good, so there is some optimism that, treated conservatively, he can respond and come back and play,” Boone said. “But we’ll know that in a couple weeks.”
In his absence, the Yankees will lean on D.J. LeMahieu at third base, and they have called up the utility man Tyler Wade from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
The list of key Yankees who are either injured or still returning from injury now contains eight players: Stanton, Andujar, shortstop Didi Gregorius, outfielders Aaron Hicks and Jacoby Ellsbury, and pitchers Dellin Betances, C. C. Sabathia and Luis Severino. In that group, there are a combined 17 All-Star appearances, one Cy Young Award winner (Sabathia) and one most valuable player (Stanton).
“It’s unfortunate right now,” Stanton said before the game, “but I guess it’s better to be in the beginning than at the end of the year.”
Stanton, 29, played every inning of the Orioles series in left field and was 2 for 8 at the plate with four strikeouts and seven walks. He later revealed that he felt discomfort while swinging during a third-inning at-bat on the chilly Sunday evening.
He considered alerting Yankees coaches but instead chalked it up to a cramp. When the tightness in his arm persisted after the game and he started thinking it had affected the quickness of his swing, Stanton informed the team.
A magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed a Grade 1 strain — the mildest on a scale of three — so Stanton will be shut down for 10 days and, according to Boone, could return at any point this month.
“I don’t like it at all,” Stanton said. “Just worked for six weeks to get here, plus the off-season. I’d much rather this would’ve popped in spring training. But that’s where we’re at. I don’t have to start from scratch when I come back.”
”
Still, as the injuries have piled up during spring training and in the early days of the season, the Yankees’ depth has been getting a stiff early test.
“People asked me all spring how I like the team, and I tell people I love the team not just because of the guys we have in the room but the depth that we have,” outfielder Brett Gardner said. “Obviously we’re not expecting to get that depth tested this early on, but here we are April 1 and already making moves. Guys will just have to step up and get the job done.”
Against the Tigers, the remaining Yankees provided victory. Domingo German, a rotation fill-in, provided five stout innings while catcher Gary Sanchez and Gardner each homered.
Betances may be among the first of the injured Yankees to return this month, as Boone said he was progressing well after shoulder inflammation late in spring training. Sabathia, who is serving a five-game suspension stemming from an episode in which he threw at Tampa Bay’s Jesus Sucre in a game last fall, is also expected back this month. Once his suspension ends, Sabathia will move to the I.L. since he is a few weeks behind his fellow starting pitchers because of off-season operations on his heart and knee.
Severino is expected back from a shoulder injury in May, and Gregorius is expected to return from Tommy John surgery sometime during the summer. It is unclear when Ellsbury, who missed all of the 2018 season and was originally expected to be ready for spring training, could be ready for the major leagues since he is still recovering from hip surgery last year and a flare-up of a foot ailment.
Hicks’s nagging back injury has improved recently, but it required two cortisone shots. He has been out since March 1 and has not yet resumed baseball activities. “I don’t think it’s going to be deep into the season by any means, but he’s still got some weeks to go,” Boone said.
The Yankees once had six outfielders on the roster, but now three are on the I.L. Their outfield options now consist of Aaron Judge; Clint Frazier, who was also called up from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Monday; Michael Tauchman, who was acquired in a trade just before the season began; and Gardner.
Boone said Frazier would play frequently in Stanton’s absence. Frazier, once a top prospect who missed most of last season with a concussion, has hit .238 in limited opportunities in the major leagues over the past two years but made improvements to his swing this spring.

NEW YORK — The Alliance of American Football league is suspending operations before it can crown its first champions, but that is not stopping FanDuel's sportsbook from declaring a winner. 
FanDuel Group, a unit of Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair PLC, on Wednesday said the Orlando Apollos should have been the AAF champs and that it would pay out all straight futures wagers as winners.
"For the fans that bet on the AAF, the least they should expect is for a competition to conclude as it should," FanDuel said in a statement. "We believe this is the very definition of a bad beat for sports fans everywhere."
The payouts apply to bets in New Jersey since FanDuel did not take any bets on the AAF in West Virginia or Pennsylvania, where it also operates sportsbooks.
This week, AAF owner Tom Dundon suspended operations after only eight weeks of game play following a number of operational and financial setbacks, according to media reports.
As the new legal U.S. sports betting market grows state by state, some operators have chosen to refund or pay out wagers where they think betters have gotten an especially bad break.
Such moves can serve to win over betters to legal, regulated bookmakers instead of the many pervasive illegal offshore websites.
In February, PointsBet refunded New Jerseyans' wagers after Duke University star player Zion Williamson's sneaker split open.

Tiger Woods is taking his match-play prowess on the road -- again -- in a series of head-to-head matches set to stream on GolfTV's over-the-top (OTT) platforms, according to Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav.
Zaslav announced the news on Wednesday while speaking at the CAA World Congress of Sports at Monarch Beach Resort in Dana Point, Calif., and said one match is already planned for Tokyo and most will take place outside of the United States.
No timeline was given for when the matches will begin.
"Tiger is going to decide what is the best format," Zaslav said. "Should it be one-on-one? Two-on-two? Should we have two matches going on at the same time? But he's all in."
GolfTV was announced last year as part of a long-term partnership between Discovery and the PGA Tour. In November 2018, Discovery secured a multi-year deal with Woods to provide exclusive content for the international streaming service, which launched in January.
Zaslav cited Woods' made-for-TV spectacle, "The Match," with Phil Mickelson last Thanksgiving weekend as inspiration for the GolfTV series. The event, hosted by Turner Sports as a pay-per-view event on its B/R Live platform, logged 750,000 unique users.
"We looked at it and said, ‘(That's) pretty interesting,'" he said. "One million people came in and wanted to watch it -- could we improve on it? What could we do? So, we're going to do a number of those type events (and) Tiger's excited about it."
Woods lost to Denmark's Lucas Bjerregaard in the quarterfinals of last week's WGC-Dell Match Play in Austin, Texas. His next Tour start will be next week's Masters, where Woods will go for his fifth green jacket and first since 2005.

(Reuters) - Wolverhampton Wanderers are set to confirm the permanent signing of Raul Jimenez from Benfica for a club-record fee of 30 million pounds, British media reported on Thursday.
The 27-year-old striker has scored 15 goals in 37 appearances since joining Wolves on a season-long loan in June 2018.
Sky Sports reported Jimenez had agreed personal terms on a four-year deal, with the fee surpassing the 18 million pounds Wolves paid for Adama Traore last August.
Mexico international Jimenez has helped Wolves reach seventh in the Premier League and an FA Cup semi-final place against Watford on Sunday.

In a sudden blow to women’s professional sports in North America, the Canadian Women’s Hockey League announced on Sunday that it would discontinue operations on May 1.
The C.W.H.L., founded in 2007, operated as a centrally funded, nonprofit enterprise. It included some of the sport’s biggest stars, like Hilary Knight and Marie-Philip Poulin.
Laurel Walzak, chairwoman of the league’s board of directors, said that the C.W.H.L.’s management had realized in the past few weeks that funding would not be available to continue next season.
“We realized this model is no longer viable in the economics and the future of the C.W.H.L.,” Walzak said. “We voted on this Friday night.”
The C.W.H.L. had six teams spread across Canada, Massachusetts and China. Last weekend, it held its championship game, which was broadcast live in Canada and the United States. The C.W.H.L.’s closing leaves the National Women’s Hockey League, founded in 2015, as the only pro hockey option for women in North America.
In recent years, players have pushed for a single league. The N.W.H.L., which has five teams in the United States, will look into becoming a new home for some of the almost 150 C.W.H.L. players who will soon be without a team.
“We will pursue any and all opportunities to ensure the best players in Canada have a place to play,” said Dani Rylan, the founder and commissioner of the N.W.H.L. “Those conversations have started already and have quickly become a priority.”
Sunday’s announcement shocked C.W.H.L. players, many of whom are Olympians for the United States and Canada and are in Finland preparing for the world championships. Poulin and other players tweeted a statement saying that they had been informed of the closing on Sunday morning and that it would be “hard to remain optimistic” that they would find a new home.
In June 2017, the C.W.H.L. announced its expansion to China with the addition of two teams. The move was intended to present a wealth of sponsorship and other business opportunities. Beijing is preparing to host the 2022 Olympics, and the N.H.L. has made increasing its footprint in Asia a priority.
Three months later, the C.W.H.L. began paying players for the first time. Under a salary cap of 100,000 Canadian dollars, player stipends ranged from $2,000 to $10,000. That figure was the same this season, but there were signs that the growth of the league was not as bountiful as had been expected, including the Chinese clubs’ merging into one franchise this season.
Walzak and Jayna Hefford, who took over as interim commissioner when Brenda Andress left the organization last summer, said that China was a great opportunity for the league and that the clubs in Asia provided significant funding but that the expenses of running five North American teams, compounded with the exhaustive efforts to build sponsorships, ticket and merchandise sales in the United States and Canada, were straining the C.W.H.L. model.
“The infrastructure wasn’t there to make it work,” said Brant Feldman, an agent who has represented several Olympic and pro women’s hockey players. “You need a full-time staff to go out and market the sport, sell tickets, do sponsorships, understand integrated marketing communications and operate the professional sport. Neither league has that.”
Walzak said that the board was in the process of sorting out its finances from this season but that it expected that all payments owed would be made soon.
The C.W.H.L. had relationships with several N.H.L. teams and the N.H.L. players’ association, but the N.H.L. has always appeared hesitant to embrace professional women’s hockey, choosing not to get in between the two North American leagues. Last November, W. Graeme Roustan, a noted investor in hockey ventures who said he was the largest investor in the league, announced that he was withdrawing his funding.
In a statement on Sunday, an N.H.L. spokesman indicated that the news would not result in any changes from the league’s perspective. The statement said: “The N.H.L.’s position has been consistent for some time and remains unchanged with this news: we would consider starting a women’s league if there were no alternatives for women to play professionally in North America.”
The N.H.L.P.A. also issued a statement, which said: “While this news is certainly disappointing — for the fans as well as the players — we hope that appropriate opportunities for these players will be available soon. We wish the players all the best.”
Hefford said other stakeholders had expressed interest in continuing to help the sport. After the 2018 Olympics, American and Canadian players discussed the possibility of working together to reach the goal of a single league, but nothing materialized.
Digit Murphy, a former coach in the C.W.H.L., said that women’s sports should not have to be dependent on men’s pro sports for resources and that the current pool of players was strong enough to produce a successful model.

TAMPA, Fla. — Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw has been on the Final Four stage nine times in her career. She has answered hundreds of questions about her team, about her rivalry with Connecticut’s Geno Auriemma, about the state of women’s basketball. But her news conference on Thursday was different. It was passionate, and it was personal.
Muffet McGraw has had enough.
Enough of the declining percentage of women coaching women’s basketball teams. Enough of the limited female representation in Congress. Enough of confining gender roles. Enough of the gender pay gap.
“Men run the world. Men have the power. Men make the decisions. It’s always the man that is the stronger one,” McGraw said, her voice rising in response to a question about saying in a recent ThinkProgress article that she would not hire another man for her coaching staff.
“When these girls are coming out, who are they looking up to to tell them that’s not the way it has to be?” McGraw continued. “Where better to do that than in sports? All these millions of girls that play sports across the country, we’re teaching them great things about life skills, but wouldn’t it be great if we could teach them to watch how women lead?”
In 1972, when the gender equity law known as Title IX was enacted, women were head coaches of more than 90 percent of the women’s college teams across two dozen sports. The percentage has decreased to about 40 now. The numbers are slightly better for women’s basketball, the most visible collegiate sport for women; about 59 percent of women’s college basketball teams were coached by women last year compared with 79 percent in 1977.
Though the issue is not new, it has been especially prominent on the sport’s biggest stage this week. Tennessee has not been to a Final Four since 2008, but the program’s coaching vacancy has been widely discussed.
Pat Summitt coached Tennessee for decades, building the program into a perennial powerhouse and making herself a leading figure in the sport. Holly Warlick, Summitt’s longtime assistant, took over when Summit left in 2012 because of early onset dementia. Warlick was fired last week, and Tennessee is conducting its first search for a women’s basketball coach in 45 years.
When Louisville Coach Jeff Walz was mentioned as a candidate, a loud debate about the ramifications of that decision ensued. Would Tennessee hire a man to run the House that Pat Built? And should it matter if the coach is a man or a woman, as long as they’re qualified?
McGraw said — loudly, pointedly — that it definitely matters.
“When you look at men’s basketball, 99 percent of the jobs go to men, why shouldn’t 100 or 99 percent of the jobs in women’s basketball go to women?” she said. “Maybe it’s because we only have 10 percent women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people who look like them. That’s the problem.”
McGraw’s comments also addressed topics like the failed Equal Rights Amendment and female representation in politics.
“I’m getting tired of the novelty of the first female governor of this state, the first female African-American mayor of this city. When is it going to become the norm instead of the exception?” she said, adding: “We don’t have enough female role models. We don’t have enough visible women leaders. We don’t have enough women in power.”
Notre Dame, the defending national champion, will meet UConn in a national semifinal on Friday night, the latest chapter in an intense rivalry that has played out on the court and in the news media for more than a decade. The assistants for both teams are all women.
Aware of McGraw’s vow not to hire another man, Auriemma pulled no punches when he responded this week.
“I hope she sends a thank you to all those guys that used to be on her staff that got her all those good players that won a championship,” he said.
Auriemma’s leading recruiter for 34 seasons has been the associate head coach, Chris Dailey. While building teams that won 11 N.C.A.A. titles at Connecticut, Dailey has been offered countless head coaching jobs, but she stayed to sustain the Huskies’ success.
“Women can be empowered by a lot of people, men included,” Dailey said after McGraw spoke on Thursday. “Opportunity for women is important, and it’s being brought to the forefront, which is amazing. But I do think you want good people in the game without excluding anyone.”
Auriemma has long been an advocate for women in the sport, but he disagreed with the idea of limiting opportunities for men.
“I just come at it from a different standpoint,” he said Thursday. “I just like to think that there’s probably a way to do one without the expense of another.”
He pointed to Oregon Coach Kelly Graves, the other man coaching in the Final Four this weekend. “So they weren’t trying to advance women’s basketball or women by hiring Kelly? That was a bad move? They should have just found the best available woman?”

Canadian children age 12 and younger will no longer be able to play the fullest version of tackle football starting in 2022. The restriction was devised by Football Canada, the sanctioning body for youth football in the country, as the latest in a series of steps to protect players from concussions and potential long-term cognitive problems.
Randy Ambrosie, the commissioner of the Canadian Football League, which works closely with Football Canada, announced the change Wednesday in Ottawa at a parliamentary hearing on concussions and sports.
“While we enthusiastically support tackle football for older age groups, we are putting a huge emphasis on flag football for young girls and boys,” Ambrosie said.
Football Canada has a number of categories for the versions of tackle football children can play and when they can do so. Already, children 8 or younger are not allowed to play tackle football. Children 10 and younger are allowed to play only six-on-six tackle football, or non-contact versions of the game, like flag football.
The new rule for will prohibit children 12 and under from playing 12-on-12 football, the version of the game used in Canadian colleges and in professional leagues. Children from 10 to 12 years old will still be able to play six-on-six tackle football and nine-on-nine, as well as non-contact football.
Some research has shown that people who started playing tackle football before age 12 were at greater risk of developing cognitive problems later in life, compared with those who started playing tackle football after age 12.
In some ways, Canada has taken more steps to protect its players than the United States has. In 2017, for instance, the Canadian Football League barred players from deliberately slamming into one another during regular-season practices, and while they still wear helmets, they no longer wear shoulder pads and other protective gear in practices.
The N.F.L. has reduced, but not eliminated, full-contact practices during the season. The Ivy League is the only United States college conference to have ended full-contact football practices in the regular season.
The C.F.L. also added a third bye week to its 18-game calendar so there would be more time between games for players to recover.
Ambrosie, who played nine seasons in the C.F.L. and became commissioner of the league in 2017, has accelerated the introduction of safety measures partly to ward off potential lawsuits, but also to restore confidence in the sport, which has been losing players faster than in the United States.
The number of children in Canada playing tackle or non-contact forms of football has plummeted since 2010, to 100,000 from 170,000, according to government surveys and research by the C.F.L.
“Support for football in this country is underwhelming and disappointing,” Ambrosie told lawmakers in the House of Commons Subcommittee on Sports-Related Concussions. “At times it can feel like it’s under attack.”

LONDON — England football manager Gareth Southgate received the OBE award at Buckingham Palace on Thursday after steering the national team to the World Cup semi-finals in Russia last Summer.
Southgate, 48, dressed in his trademark waistcoat, was presented the award for services to football by Prince Charles after he was included in Queen Elizabeth's 2019 New Year's honours list. 
"It's very special," he told Sky Sports TV after the ceremony. "It's a privilege to be the English manager and to receive an award from the royal family - as a proud royal fan, that was very special. It's a moment that will live with me for ever."
Last month, team captain Harry Kane received the MBE award. He was top scorer with six goals in Russia but the team was knocked out after a 2-1 loss to Croatia in the semi-finals.
Southgate's OBE came as England climbed one place to fourth in FIFA's latest world rankings after Euro 2020 qualifying victories over the Czech Republic and Montenegro.

OR YEHUDA, Israel — Darting between the goal posts with his striking white hair, 73-year-old Israeli Isaak Hayik set a new world record on Friday as the oldest person to play in a professional soccer match. 
Hayik, who celebrates his 74th birthday next week, broke the record after playing as a goalkeeper in an afternoon game with Israel's Ironi Or Yehuda soccer club.
The Iraqi-born keeper was officially recognized in an award ceremony attended by representatives from the Guinness World Record organization. 
"I'm ready for another game," said Hayik, who made some good saves in the team's 5-1 defeat to Maccabi Ramat Gan. 
"This is not only a source of pride for me but also to Israeli sports in general," added Hayik, who moved to Israel when he was four years old.
The previous record was held by Robert Carmona of Uruguay, who in 2015 played a professional match with Uruguay's Pan de Azucar at the age of 53, an official adjudicator for Guinness World Records said.
Hayik's family were among the tens of thousands of Iraqi Jews who fled to Israel in the mid-20th century, following the country's creation in 1948. 
His children spoke of their pride in their father's achievement. One of his sons said he and his father used to play together. 
"I used to get tired before he did," Moshe Hayik, 36, said. "He is unbelievable."

The Arizona Diamondbacks' Adam Jones had a fan removed from San Diego's Petco Park during Wednesday night's game for spewing profane language, the outfielder told AZCentral.com.
Jones, who is from San Diego, said the fan was "cussing me out" while tracking down a fly ball in right field during the fifth inning of Arizona's 4-1 loss to the Padres.
"These fans in sports, man, they're starting to get a little more brazen," Jones told AZCentral. "My biggest thing is, keep the banter polite - we suck, I struck out, the team's not good. Keep it light, keep it smart. ... But the second you start cussing me out like I'm a little kid, that's a no-no.
"On the street, they'd never do that. In the ballpark when you've paid your admission, there's no need for all that stuff. The second I hear somebody cussing us out, you're gone," Jones said. "I made a nice play, and just hearing the B-word, F-word, that's not baseball talk. So ... he gone."
Jones made national headlines in 2017 when, as a member of Baltimore Orioles, he claimed to be on the receiving end of racial taunts and having a bag of peanuts thrown on him at Fenway Park during a game in early May.
The incident resulted in an investigation and official apology from the Red Sox as well as condemnations from the Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor.

In two weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s primary legislative body, the Division I Council, will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfers.
By Billy Witz
MINNEAPOLIS — When Matt Mooney was refurbishing used basketball shoes and selling them out of the trunk of his car in high school, that entrepreneurial streak looked as if it would carry him further than basketball. At the time, he had only one Division I scholarship offer.
When Tariq Owens was at a renowned prep school, as a bouncy, loose-limbed, four-star recruit, an N.B.A. career seemed less like a pipe dream than a reasonable career path. College would serve as finishing school.
But several years (and universities) later, there they were last weekend in Anaheim, Calif., with fists clenched and arms raised triumphantly overhead, as unlikely teammates — and improbable one-season catalysts — in helping Texas Tech reach the Final Four for the first time.
Mooney and Owens arrived at Texas Tech less than a year ago as a less heralded type of one-and-done player, having taken advantage of the N.C.A.A.’s graduate transfer rule, which allows athletes who have earned a degree and have eligibility remaining to switch colleges without having to sit out a year.
The graduate transfer rule, the rare N.C.A.A. regulation that gives leverage to the athlete, has been used by hundreds of players since it was relaxed in 2011. And at a moment when athletic admission graft, shoe company payola and questions about whether a transcendent (and unpaid) figure like Zion Williamson should even risk playing college basketball at all, the graduate transfer rule casts the beleaguered N.C.A.A. as reasonable and almost munificent.
It is also a rule that may not last much longer.
In two weeks, the N.C.A.A.’s primary legislative body, the Division I Council, will vote on a measure that could severely restrict graduate transfers. The proposed rule change would require that colleges accepting graduate transfers be docked a scholarship the next year if the transfer does not earn his secondary degree within a year.
So as graduate transfers have continued to increase — there were 124 this season in men’s basketball, according to the website GradTransferTracker, including a handful who were key contributors on N.C.A.A. tournament teams — and as programs have found value in them as a quick fix that suits both team and player, the new rule is seeking to discourage them by effectively adding a tax on programs that accept such players.
“That’s really draconian,” Rodney Fort, a sports economist and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, said of the rule change. “This is like losing a scholarship from an N.C.A.A. penalty.”
The proposal, which could go into effect as soon as Aug. 1, would apply to only three sports — football, women’s basketball and men’s basketball — but appears particularly aimed at men’s basketball. Football teams, with 85 scholarships, are far more capable of coping with the loss of a single scholarship than a men’s basketball squad, which has 13. And there are roughly twice as many graduate transfers each year in men’s basketball as in women’s basketball.
Justin Sell, the athletic director at South Dakota State who led the Division I transfer working group that developed the proposal, said that too often graduate transfers in men’s basketball and football had little interest in obtaining graduate degrees.
“We really want to protect against the football player who is done and leaves in December and the basketball player who is done and leaves in March,” Sell said. “A lot of students are looking to use it to play another year. Who’s seriously there for the master’s?”
Sell said that the committee surveyed athletic directors, faculty representatives, senior woman administrators, coaches and athletes over 18 months. Still, the fingerprints of basketball coaches in the working group’s recommendation were not hard to miss. The lone men’s basketball voice on the committee was St. Joseph’s Coach Phil Martelli, who in a widely publicized 2011 case blocked one of his graduating players from transferring by refusing to sign a release. Partially as a result of that case, releases are no longer required. (Martelli, who was fired by St. Joseph’s last month, declined to comment through a university spokesman.)
The rule itself seems to have come straight from the mouth of Kentucky Coach John Calipari, who suggested to ESPN in 2016 — long before the committee began its work — that “if the kid gets his grad degree in one year, fine; if he doesn’t, you’ve got to use the scholarship for two years.”
Sell conceded objections about practicality (many graduate programs take two years to complete) and fairness (the rule does not apply to athletes who compete as graduate students without transferring) were fair, but said his group’s intent was to “manage behavior.”
“When you’re trying to manage behavior and put together policies and rules in trying to create ethical behavior and integrity, there are challenges to that,” Sell said. “It’s really hard to police integrity.”
But the rule change leaves no room to assess the motivations of players who, degrees in hand, seek new horizons with their remaining eligibility. The Ivy League, for example, does not allow its teams to play graduate students; that led the former Yale guard Makai Mason — who had missed his junior season with a broken foot — to help Baylor to the N.C.A.A. tournament this spring. The rule also gave the former Stanford player Reid Travis the opening he needed to take his N.B.A. hopes, and his final year of eligibility, to Kentucky for some postgraduate basketball education.
Geno Crandall, who had begun his college career at North Dakota, ended it as a reserve guard at Gonzaga this spring.
“I kind of wanted a different experience,” said Crandall, who said he had sought out Mooney, whom he had met when Mooney was at South Dakota, for advice on the transfer process. Crandall is working toward a master’s degree in organizational leadership at Gonzaga but said he took a lighter course load, two classes per semester, so that he could focus on basketball.
“Honestly, I’m actually enjoying it a lot more than I did undergrad,” Crandall said before the Zags lost to Mooney’s Red Raiders in the West Region final last weekend. “There’s a lot more discussion that goes into it, a lot more adult feel. This is more tailored to what you find interesting.”
Gonzaga’s Crandall said he was only vaguely aware of the proposed restrictions on graduate transfers. But he did not like the idea that a rule change might deny future players the path he had chosen.
“Whether it’s good or bad, the N.C.A.A. tries to take a lot of control away from players,” he said. “You commit to a school and they tell you they want you to play and help you get your degree, so I feel like once you get your degree your obligations are kind of fulfilled.”
Nearly 40 percent of Division I men’s basketball players who arrive from high school will transfer by the end of their sophomore year, according to N.C.A.A. data from 2011 to 2017. Owens and Mooney, now in the Final Four, were in that group.
Owens left Tennessee after his freshman year when its coach was fired. He transferred to St. John’s, where he earned a degree in sports management. Mooney left Air Force, unhappy with the military lifestyle, for South Dakota, where he got a degree in innovation and entrepreneurship. He was content to remain there for his final year until his coach, Craig Smith, left for Utah State last April.
With eligibility left because of their transfers, Owens and Mooney hit the graduate transfer market seeking the same thing — a place where they could win (neither had been to the N.C.A.A. tournament) and burnish their skills for a possible pro career. Texas Tech turned out to be a perfect match: a program on the rise with a respected coach, Chris Beard, and a roster that was a perfect fit for Owens, a 6-foot-10 shot-blocker and finisher, and Mooney, a ball-hawking point guard who could find his shot.
“This is an environment where I knew I’d be able to work and I’d be coached hard,” Owens said. “I like being in environments where you’ve got something to prove.”
At Texas Tech, Owens, 23, and Mooney, 24, are enrolled in a master’s program for interdisciplinary studies, taking three classes in the fall and spring that are tailored to their interests. Mooney is taking two of his classes online.
“My primary focus is basketball, to try to set myself up for the pros,” said Mooney, who is studying educational leadership. “Academics aren’t a huge priority right now, but you’ve still got to take care of it. I’ve got my degree — that’s what’s most important.”
He added: “I didn’t leave places because I wasn’t satisfied with playing time or things like that. I definitely didn’t want it to go this way. I didn’t want to go to three different schools. I wanted to go to one school, play there four years, have a great career and have a home to go back to and graduate. But sometimes life doesn’t work out that way.”
An earlier version of this article misidentified the university at which Geno Crandall began his college basketball career. It was North Dakota, not North Dakota State.

(Reuters) - Former captain Alastair Cook believes England have an "outstanding chance" to lift the World Cup on home soil, having built a squad full of proven match winners.
Eoin Morgan's top-ranked side enter the tournament as the one of the most consistent teams in the format and their quest for a first 50-overs title begins against South Africa at The Oval on May 30.
Since their shock group-stage exit from the 2015 World Cup, England have been particularly strong at home, winning 30 of their 42 ODIs while losing only nine.
"England have an outstanding chance," Cook, who retired last year from international cricket, told Sky Sports. 
"This is first time going into a World Cup England have such a settled squad. Everything looks great from the outside, they have every option covered."
England failed to cope with raised expectations at the 2017 Champions Trophy when they lost to eventual winners Pakistan in the semi-finals.
Cook is positive such blips can only make a team mentally stronger.
Since the start of last year, England have come out on top in bilateral ODI series against World Cup holders Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and India.
"They had that blip in the (2017) Champions Trophy, where they lost in the semi-final to Pakistan when they were favourites, but you need those lows to be able to grow as a side," he added.
"They are favourites. This is a great opportunity for Eoin (Morgan) and the guys to play some fantastic cricket. 
"There are match winners throughout the squad, there are batsmen that can win games on their own, and over the last six or eight months the bowling has really come on. I think they are going to win it."

The Alliance of American Football is planning to suspend operations and will not play games this weekend, according to three people familiar with the decision who were not authorized to speak publicly.
The league isn’t officially folding, the people said Tuesday, at least not yet. An official announcement about its status was expected soon. In a statement, Bill Polian, one of the league’s founders, confirmed the decision and expressed disappointment.
The Alliance is the latest in a long line of upstart professional football leagues that tried and failed to capitalize on the seemingly insatiable appetite for the sport in America. Because the N.F.L. draws an average of about 15 million viewers for each game over its five-month season, the start-up owners tend to assume that a new league with just a fraction of that audience will succeed.
It hasn’t turned out that way.
Since the American Football League merged with the N.F.L. in 1970, there has been the World Football League, the United States Football League, the once and future XFL, the United Football League and others. While they have had varying business models, franchise locations and opinions on the best calendar for football, none of the leagues has yet found the right formula for sustained success.
Now it seems the Alliance for American Football will soon follow them to the grave.
The league’s chief executive and co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, probably should have known better. He the son of Dick Ebersol, the longtime NBC Sports chairman who started the first iteration of the XFL nearly 20 years ago, alongside the professional wrestling impresario Vince McMahon. That league folded after a single season.
With the help of Polian, the former general manager of the Indianapolis Colts, Ebersol secured distribution deals for some of the league’s games on CBS, TNT and the NFL Network, a strong sign for a new league. The deals included little cash, however, according to two of the people.
“I think there is a blind spot for most people that want to start professional sports leagues,” said Michael Huyghue, who was the commissioner of the United Football League. “The biggest issue is: What is the revenue stream? What is the revenue model?” The U.F.L. began play in 2009 and ceased operations in 2012.
Most leagues require substantial television rights payments to survive, as well as a critical mass of ticket sales. Both are difficult to obtain for an unproven league. Knowing how substantial the start-up costs would be, the Alliance tried to justify its operations by comparing itself to a Silicon Valley tech company that expects to lose money for years while creating value. Ebersol believed the league’s technology and readiness for legalized gambling would make it a success.
From the beginning, Ebersol had modest expectations for Year One.
“There are going to be empty seats for quite some time, but we are committed to long-term investment around the idea,” he said in an interview in February, shortly before the season began.
He estimated the Alliance would require $500 million to $750 million during the first five years.
“You have to justify that expense, because either you are an eccentric billionaire creating a football league or raising really smart money that is patient,” Ebersol said.
The Alliance’s eight teams, clustered in the Southeast and Southwest, began play after the Super Bowl. They have each played eight regular season games, with the championship game scheduled for April 27 in Frisco, Tex.
But almost from the beginning, there were signs that things weren’t going well, including reports that the league had almost missed payroll.
Last week the league’s controlling owner, Tom Dundon, told USA Today that the league was in danger of folding because it hadn’t secured an agreement with the N.F.L. and the N.F.L. Players Association to allow young players from N.F.L. rosters to work in the Alliance.
“If the players union is not going to give us young players, we can’t be a development league,” said Dundon, who is also the owner of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes. Just two weeks into the Alliance’s game schedule, he committed up to $250 million and became the controlling owner.
But to Huyghue, whose United Football League lasted almost four seasons, that was the wrong focus.
“Everyone keeps thinking players, players, players,” he said. “That doesn’t solve your revenue problem.”
Polian’s statement blamed Dundon for the decision to suspend the league. “When Mr. Dundon took over, it was the belief of my co-founder, Charlie Ebersol, and myself that we would finish the season, pay our creditors, and make the necessary adjustments to move forward in a manner that made economic sense for all,” Polian said.
Dundon could not be reached for comment.
Despite the poor track record, the Alliance surely won’t be the last attempt to start a new professional football league. McMahon is reviving the XFL, which is to begin play next year, and last week he sold almost $272 million in World Wrestling Entertainment stock to support the venture, according to a company filing. The Pacific Pro League, founded by Don Yee, Tom Brady’s agent, is also set to start playing next year.
The A.A.F.’s decision to shut down has immediate repercussions for at least one of the Alliance’s partners. Saturday afternoon’s game between Memphis and San Antonio was scheduled to be shown on CBS, serving as the lead-in to the two men’s Final Four college basketball games.

Soccer officials from one of FIFA’s largest confederations have gathered this week in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur, to elect a president. The balloting will take place at the end of a long day of speeches, motions and reports, but at least the setting — the luxurious Shangri-La Hotel — promises to be comfortable.
Before the vote is held, the incumbent, Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa of Bahrain, will have the opportunity to make a speech outlining his qualifications. His opponent will not.
That is because, as usual, there is no opponent.
For the third time in less than a year — the fourth will come in June — one of soccer’s largest and most powerful governing bodies will rubber-stamp the election of its leader in a one-candidate election. South America’s governing body, Conmebol, went first last May, when it granted President Alejandro Domínguez an unopposed second term, and Europe’s governing body, UEFA, followed suit in February by re-electing Aleksandr Ceferin. In June, FIFA’s president, Gianni Infantino, will retain his post in yet another walkover.
“There has always seemed to be a great deal of fear around challenging the incumbent and because of the potential for retribution built into the system,” said Alexandra Wrage, president of the corporate governance adviser Trace International. For that reason, she said, regular uncontested elections are “not all that surprising.”
Wrage previously advised FIFA on corporate governance reforms before quitting in 2013. She has since become one of the organization’s most vocal critics.
In Asia, Sheikh Salman had been challenged — briefly — by opponents from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, two countries at the center of a broad political dispute that has spilled into soccer in a variety of ways, but both dropped out of the race late last month after a series of behind-the-scenes meetings in the Gulf.
Sheikh Salman’s presidency has been marred by controversy since he was elected in 2013 to replace Mohamed Bin Hammam, a wealthy Qatari businessman who was banned for life in the wake of a corruption investigation. His connections to Bahrain’s royal family, for example, have led to Sheikh Salman’s recusing himself from a role in some of the Asian Football Confederation’s most sensitive decisions, such as in the highly publicized case of Hakeem al-Araibi, a soccer player who fled to Australia after claiming he had been tortured by the Bahraini government during pro-democracy demonstrations there in 2011.
Salman also did not take part in discussions over how to deal with the pirating of the A.F.C.’s Qatari broadcast partner’s programing by an illegal operation based in Saudi Arabia. Bahrain is among the countries backing the Saudi-led blockade of Qatar.
The re-election of incumbents, routinely without opposition, is common in soccer, where the power structures remain closely held despite a sprawling investigation in 2015 by the United States Department of Justice that exposed corruption schemes at the highest levels of the sport dating back decades.
The American case largely avoided implicating officials in Asia, but by then regional soccer leaders had already faced a reckoning after a series of internal investigations into the conduct of Sheikh Salman’s predecessor, Bin Hammam, and his leadership team. Those reports, including one by the former F.B.I. chief Louis Freeh, exposed a series of unexplained payments made to soccer officials throughout Asia and Africa.
The reports, three in total, which have been reviewed by The New York Times, exposed a series of payments made on behalf of Bin Hammam by the A.F.C.’s longtime media partner, World Sports Group, and specifically its regional head, the Lebanese businessman Pierre Kakhia. The payments included legal fees for an official from Tahiti who was facing an ethics ban, and money to a consulting firm hired to promote Bin Hammam’s bid for the FIFA presidency.
Despite his links to Bin Hammam, Kakhia remains a trusted consultant to the A.F.C., currently responsible for handling millions of dollars worth of sponsorship contracts, even though he last worked for W.S.G.’s parent company in 2016.
The A.F.C. declined to say why it had retained the services of Kakhia.
As well as Sheikh Salman’s re-election, delegates at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur will pick candidates for coveted places on global soccer’s ruling body, the FIFA Council. That contest, featuring eight candidates vying for six places, has proved to be contentious.
South Korean officials have complained to the A.F.C. over perceived double standards in ethics rules after their country was barred from inviting soccer officials to Seoul to attend an exhibition game last month, a prohibition that was not extended to Qatar, which wrote to officials inviting them on an all-expenses paid trip to attend two matches there. Both South Korea and Qatar have candidates in the election, as does the Philippines, whose candidate, the South Koreans contend, has been using a private jet owned by a Qatari official to travel across the region during his campaign.
“We urgently request you to review this matter in relation to any violation against the relevant regulations in force,” the Korean soccer federation president, Chong Mong-gyu, wrote in a letter to the A.F.C. The A.F.C., which confirmed it had received the South Koreans’ complaint, declined to say why it had not issued the same warning to Qatar.
Sheikh Salman’s challengers dropped out of the presidential race after a series of decisions by the A.F.C., including the surprising move to break an exclusive television contract with the A.F.C.’s broadcast partner, the Qatari broadcaster BeIN Sports, in order to allow games to be broadcast in Saudi Arabia, where games have been broadcast illegally for almost two years. BeIN said it planned to sue the A.F.C. over the decision.
Until that decision, Saudi Arabia had been supporting an Emirati candidate, Mohammad Khalfan al-Rumaithi. Rumaithi withdrew his candidacy shortly after the television agreement was struck. The third candidate, Saoud al-Mohannadi of Qatar, soon followed suit.

With just over 40 seconds left to play in a fairly meaningless game between the playoff-bound Oklahoma City Thunder and the lottery-bound Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday, Isaac Bonga, a 19-year-old Lakers rookie, badly missed a 15-foot shot. Russell Westbrook, the veteran Thunder guard, snatched the ball out of the air for a defensive rebound.
“That’s for Nipsey!” he declared, referring to the rapper Nipsey Hussle, whose fatal shooting over the weekend seemed to shake many N.B.A. players.
Westbrook’s presence on the floor in the closing moments of an easy 119-103 home victory for the Thunder would usually have been odd, but on this night the modern master of the triple-double was out there to grab his 20th rebound of the night.
Combined with his 20 points and 21 assists, the rebound made Westbrook the second 20-20-20 player in N.B.A. history, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He joined Wilt Chamberlain, who had 22 points, 25 rebounds and 21 assists on Feb. 2, 1968.
Over the last few years, Westbrook’s triple-doubles have come so frequently that it is hard for one to stand out. He is in line for his third consecutive season of averaging a triple-double; Oscar Robertson, the only other player to compile such an average, did it just once. And along the way, Westbrook has set the record for triple-doubles in a season (42 in 2016-17) while recording a stunning 98 of them over a three-season span.
It was clear that Westbrook was headed for an interesting night when he recorded 10 assists in the first quarter.
Westbrook, a 30-year-old All-Star, had previously reached 20 rebounds in a game just once in his career, and he had topped 20 assists just four times. In his closest previous attempt at a 20-20-20 game, he had 17 points, 18 rebounds and 17 assists in a win over the Lakers during the 2016-17 season. No player other than Westbrook and Chamberlain has had even an 18-18-18 game.
In a postgame interview Tuesday, Westbrook described himself as humbled by the experience and brought the conversation back to Hussle.
“That wasn’t for me,” Westbrook said of the performance. “That was for my bro — that was for Nipsey. Twenty plus twenty plus twenty.”

MELBOURNE — Australian Rules players will tear through a banner of hateful tweets before a top flight match on Friday as part of a campaign against online bullying.
The indigenous game has been rocked by a string of social media controversies in recent weeks, with Aboriginal players suffering racist taunts and a prominent female footballer complaining of "sexual abuse" online.
To raise awareness of the problem, the Melbourne Demons will hoist a banner emblazoned with negative tweets about players and teams at the Melbourne Cricket Ground before their Australian Football League match against Essendon Bombers.
Players running through huge banners made by 'cheer squads' from crepe paper and sticky tape has been an Australian Rules tradition for over 70 years, although most showcase motivational messages or key milestones for players. 
The Demons players running through the banner on Friday would "highlight how online harassment is a major issue not just for AFL players but for the one in five young Australians who are victims of cyber-bullying", the team said.
The Demons teamed up with "Reach", a youth-focused charity set up by the late former Melbourne player and president Jim Stynes, on the initiative.
In a promotional video on the Demons' website (melbournefc.com.au), Melbourne's Aboriginal defender Neville Jetta holds up a placard with a tweet describing him as a "scum bag".
Jetta said he had been deeply affected by racist online abuse, particularly early in his career.
"In my early days I probably wasn't strong enough to call it out and they were the ones that I just deleted," the 29-year-old told an AFL chat show on local broadcaster Fox Sports.
"It's not just racism, it's actually bullying, bullying people, and AFL players have that stance where we're able to speak out to the community and people actually listen to us."
Last week, Melbourne-based AFL club Richmond Tigers handed a two-year ban to a supporter who made racially abusive comments about West Coast Eagles forward Liam Ryan.
Ryan, a 22-year-old Aboriginal, was called a "monkey" by multiple social media users on a local broadcaster's Instagram account.
The sanction came days after AFL Women's player Tayla Harris complained of "sexual abuse" after a photograph of her kicking a goal triggered a raft of offensive comments on a broadcaster's social media account.

The ball was inbounded to Notre Dame guard Arike Ogunbowale. “Four, three, two,” came the shouts, counting down the expiring clock. Ogunbowale put up the shot … and … it was an air ball.
No matter. This happened last month, during a practice at the Joyce Center in South Bend, Ind., on the day before the Fighting Irish women’s team played its regular-season finale. Notre Dame won that game, as it has won all but three games this year. It needs to win only two more to claim its second straight national championship; the first could come in the national semifinals Friday night, when Notre Dame (34-3) faces Connecticut (35-2).
[Read our preview of the N.C.A.A. Women’s Final Four here.]
Ogunbowale will be ready. Now a senior, she has made buzzer-beaters when they counted. Specifically, last year, in a sequence without precedent, Ogunbowale hit last-second shots to give her team victories in both the semifinals and the championship game.
The stunning nature of Ogunbowale’s feats catapulted her to the kind of mainstream fame rarely bestowed on women’s college basketball, which despite improved play and the introduction of a few more top programs has struggled to broaden its appeal.
Ogunbowale appeared on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” where Kobe Bryant greeted her as a surprise guest. She participated in the television competition “Dancing With The Stars.” She won the ESPY Award for play of the year.
“Shout out to women’s basketball as a whole,” she said in her acceptance speech. “There’s a lot of people with their opinions about us, but all I got to say is, come see us on the court.”
It was a telling moment: Even in triumph, winning out over other worthy nominees, mostly from men’s sports, Ogunbowale chose to promote her game.
“There’s still a long way to go, which is why we have to advocate for ourselves,” Ogunbowale said in an interview last month.
“I think our Final Four was super-exciting,” she added, noting that the other semifinal had also gone to overtime, “and that got people thinking, like, O.K., yeah, it’s actually fun to watch.”
The Final Four, and the response to it, illustrated just how intertwined the discussion of women’s basketball is with a more meta discussion about women’s basketball’s popularity.
“If Arike were on the men’s side, you take that and roll with it,” said Courtney Cox, a doctoral candidate at the University of Southern California who studies women’s basketball. “But instead she has all this pressure to come back and do it again.”
If it wins twice this weekend, Notre Dame would be only the fourth women’s basketball team to repeat as national champion. And if Ogunbowale again plays a starring role, she seems as good a candidate as any to become the rare women’s basketball star to have the kind of first-name status enjoyed by star athletes like Michael, Kobe, LeBron and Serena.
“This notion of ‘growing the game’ is this phrase we hear a lot — W.N.B.A., college game,” Cox said. “But I think the game is flourishing. Part of it is acknowledging the disparity that’s already existed, the fact that the women’s tournament has only existed on the N.C.A.A. level since 1982.”
The college basketball establishment has changed several visible aspects of the women’s game in an effort to increase its exposure. For instance, Ogunbowale’s shots might have made a larger splash because they came on a Friday and a Sunday — the nights before the men’s semifinals and title game — rather than the Sunday-Tuesday time slots that the women’s Final Four had previously occupied.
That was one of several recommendations made in a paper that Val Ackerman, the first W.N.B.A. president, wrote for the N.C.A.A. in 2013 amid fears of declining attendance, stagnant ratings and a top-heavy women’s tournament. Others included experimental rule changes, such as a 24-second shot clock and toying with a slightly lower rim; considering making women’s basketball a one-semester sport; and even hosting the men’s and women’s Final Fours in the same city (or establishing a multiyear site for the women’s event, much as Omaha always hosts the College World Series).
“The visibility levels are a bit lower than they are in the men’s,” said Ackerman, who is now the Big East commissioner. “It’s just one of the broader challenges.”
Of Ogunbowale, Ackerman added, “The aftermath of that championship for her proved that it can happen, when you have compelling performances on a national stage.”
There is more than one kind of compelling, though. One of this season’s more interesting moments also involved Ogunbowale and occurred when Connecticut visited Notre Dame for a nonconference game in December. During the game, which the Huskies won easily, Ogunbowale received a technical foul when she appeared to have words with Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma — the latest spat between the two, who once subtweeted one another when Ogunbowale dropped UConn from her list of programs during recruiting.
Neither Ogunbowale nor Notre Dame Coach Muffet McGraw would address the technical directly in interviews. But the argument that it was good for the game — that it resembled the drama that drives the N.B.A. news cycle — was made by the likes of the ESPN writer D’Arcy Maine, who said, “I’m here for all the pettiness.”
Much as the N.B.A. has ridden the personalities of its stars to greater popularity, women’s basketball’s growth will require what sports leagues have always needed: talented and charismatic stars.
“The more we can do to get the casual fan to go, ‘Oh, Notre Dame’s playing — I’m going to turn it on to see Arike,’” said McGraw, “the more interest, the more fans we’ll get.”
Coincidentally or not, broadcasts of Notre Dame regular-season games on ESPN networks were up 12 percent over last year, according to a network spokeswoman.
“It’s not there yet,” said Gregory Ogunbowale, Arike’s father. “Arike and the others are trying to put it on the map. O.K., we’re equally as good. As the father of a woman, I respect that. It’s not all about dunking, it’s about fundamentals, it’s about skills, and they have all those.”
He has noticed one difference, however. One of Arike’s older brothers, Dare, is a running back who has played for Wisconsin and now a few N.F.L. teams. In the past, Gregory said, when teachers at the Milwaukee elementary school where he is the principal would ask about Dare, others would mention that his daughter was an athlete, too. Now, he said, it’s the reverse.
“One of my colleagues a couple weeks ago passed by my office and said, ‘Hi, Arike’s Dad,’” he said. “I never heard that before.”

For riders, it comes down to the moment they step into the arena with their horses. But judges evaluating them begin working long before that moment.
In addition to determining winners, the judges must ensure a fair competition and keep the horses safe. Much of the fate of the athletes depends on their decisions, outside and inside the arena.
In show jumping, where horses jump over courses against a clock, and dressage, in which horses perform complicated routines, judges must determine that a horse is fit to compete and that the rules are being followed. Though top riders from both disciplines will gather in Goteborg, Sweden, to compete in the F.E.I. World Cup Finals, the jobs of the judges of the two sports have little in common aside from these basic duties.
Show jumping is an objectively judged sport. The Ground Jury, or panel of four judges, watches for faults as the horses and riders jump over hurdles that are more than five feet tall. Scores are based on time and whether any poles were knocked.
“The job of the Ground Jury is basically to make sure all the rules and regulations are followed throughout the competition and not only what’s happening in the arena, as such, but generally speaking what’s happening all over the venue where the competition is held,” said Sven Holmberg, who will be the president of the Ground Jury overseeing the show jumping finals in Goteborg.
In dressage, judges observe the tiny movements the horse and rider make together, watching them dance across the arena, noting every ripple and assigning a value to each movement based on how well it is completed.
The scores are based on the “quality of the training” and “the suppleness and elasticity of the horse,” said Magnus Ringmark, one of the seven judges for the dressage finals this weekend. The final mark for a rider is a composite of the scores, making it “comparable to judging ice skating; it’s an art sport,” Ringmark said. “It’s all about the performance and how it looks.”
Many judges begin as riders. They spend many years training and judging at lower levels, eventually reaching the five-star, or top-level, status, like those who will be judging in Goteborg.
The job of the judge can be roughly broken down into three phases.
Before the competition, judges of both sports must make certain that the conditions in the arena, such as the ground, will be the same for all riders. Show jumping judges also consult with the course designer to make sure the jump courses are appropriately difficult.
Once the athletes arrive at the show before the competition, the judges make sure that they are fit to compete. They watch each horse move to check for lameness or other injury, and a veterinarian checks for health issues.
“Your ability to continue on in the competition hangs in their hands,” said Laura Graves, an American dressage rider who will ride Verdades, her 17-year-old bay gelding, at the finals, but “it’s important that they’re critical for the welfare of the horse.”
If the issues seem small, or possibly just a matter of adjustment after a long trip, riders get a second chance to present their horses for inspection the next day.
“They have a look at the movement of the horse, they have a look at the general shape of the horse” before making a determination, said Christian Ahlmann, a German show jumper who will be riding his 10-year-old gray stallion Clintrexo Z at the finals. If they are asked to come back for a new inspection, “then you have a second chance, and it starts from zero,” he said.
Under a rule that has been the subject of much debate, horses can also be eliminated if there is even a drop of fresh blood on their bodies during the competition. The rule was introduced to protect the horses, but some in the sport feel it is excessive, because horses are often accident-prone and blood might not indicate abuse.
The biggest phase of a judge’s duties comes when the competition begins.
During dressage, where each rider performs a prescribed test with 33 moves and a freestyle routine, the judges are seated around the ring in different locations.
“We sit around the arena so we have different angles, and we don’t know what the other judge is doing,” Ringmark said. “If I sit and see the horse from the front, I can sometimes miss things that happen with the hind legs, for instance.”
The judges score each move from zero to 10, in seconds. The judges’ scores are compiled to reach a total score out of 100. A standard result tends to be in the 70s, with a great score pushing into the 80s, Graves said.
“The first thing we look for is the quality of the horse, or the athleticism of the horse,” said Janet Foy, a judge at last year’s finals. “With the three gaits, rhythm is the most important thing, but then we also look for scope and freedom and elasticity, sort of the wow factor.”
The judges also consider how good a horse’s training is, she said. “Ideally, at the end of the day, the best horse with the best training wins the gold medal,” she said, “so a more average horse with very good training should also score highly.”
Finally, they consider how well the move, along with the entrance into it and the departure from it, was executed, Foy said.
Ringmark said it should look easy. “It has to look like the horse wants to do it, and it has to look like the rider is not doing anything.”
One of the most important aspects of being a dressage judge, Foy said, is maintaining a sense of objectivity when evaluating the riders.
“You have to judge everyone like you’ve never seen them before,” she said. “Everyone who comes into the ring has no name, no history, no reputation, good bad or otherwise. You need to look at everybody, whether they’re first or last in the class, like a possible winner.”
In show jumping, the judges keep track of the timer and penalties, but “the best officials are the ones who are invisible,” said Robert Ridland, the chef d’équipe for the United States show jumping team. “They foresee problems before they happen, they have enough experience to be able to make the common-sense judgment call when needed.”
Such issues could include a timer that is placed poorly, which could cause a rider to accidentally set it off and cause time penalties, he said.
Judges also must make sure the competition is fair. If, for instance, it becomes very windy or rainy partway through a class, changing conditions, they may have to decide whether to continue, said Anna Lindqvist, who will be on the Ground Jury in Goteborg.
“You have always to be prepared to make a tough decision even if it’s the best rider in the world,” Lindqvist said. “We can’t have rules for everything, so we just need to use common sense and do as much as we can.”
Though judges have many considerations throughout the competition, the primary goals are to keep the horses safe and ensure fairness.
“What we do is for the love of the sport,” Foy said.

Three perennial powerhouses and an exciting interloper will seek spots in the national final.
By Kelly Whiteside
TAMPA, Fla. — The Women’s Final Four on Friday will feature three teams that have at least one national title and one team, Oregon, seeking its first. If the Ducks become the champions, they will be the first team from the West Coast to claim the women’s crown since Stanford in 1992.
Baylor, a No. 1 seed, returns to the Final Four for the first time since winning the national title in 2012, and it has been a breeze to get here. The Lady Bears rolled over their tournament opponents by an average margin of 38.2 points behind the nation’s best defense and the powerhouse duo of 6-foot-7 Kalani Brown and 6-4 Lauren Cox. This is the first trip to the Final Four for Oregon, a second seed, and it has been a fun one given the Ducks’ spread-the-floor, pick-and-roll style of play. The Ducks have been called the Golden State Warriors of women’s college basketball with their pick and triple-double machine, Sabrina Ionescu, (19.9 points, 8.2 assists and 7.5 rebounds a game) playing the role of Stephen Curry. 
“She’s an unbelievable talent, and her team is blazing a new trail for her program,” Curry said after the Warriors’ game on Wednesday.
The Ducks have the best 3-point shooting in the nation, 41.7 percent. To knock off the Lady Bears, they will need to connect at a similar rate.
The best rivalry in the women’s game will play out for the 50th time over all and for the eighth time in the Final Four. UConn, a second seed, leads the series, 37-12, but top-seeded Notre Dame has the edge at the Final Four, 4-3. The Huskies are competing in a record 12th consecutive Final Four and shooting for their 12th national championship. 
Notre Dame, the defending national champ, is even more talented, and healthier, than last year. Last year, Notre Dame knocked off UConn in overtime in the national semifinals, but the Huskies won a regular-season matchup, 89-71, in December. 
“Sports needs that kind of rivalry,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “We used to have that with Tennessee. Now we have it with Notre Dame. I think it’s cool. I think they’re the best team in the country. I don’t think anybody else is even close. Baylor. But I don’t think anybody else, I think, can match Notre Dame when they’re playing their A game. They just overwhelm you, man, at every position.” 
Notre Dame features the talented backcourt pair of Arike Ogunbowale (21.5 points a game) and Jackie Young (15.1). The UConn seniors Napheesa Collier and Katie Lou Samuelson were freshmen the last time the Huskies won the national title, in 2016, and they are focused on ending their careers with another crown.

April 5 (Reuters) - Late goals by Mohamed Salah and Jordan Henderson earned Liverpool a crucial 3-1 victory at Southampton to move them back to the top of the Premier League on Friday.
For the second week running Liverpool looked like losing ground on Manchester City in a titanic title race, but once again Juergen Klopp's side would not be denied as they edged a step closer to a first league title since 1990.
With games running out they lead City by two points, although Pep Guardiola's champions have a game in hand.
Locked at 1-1 Liverpool were laying siege to the Southampton goal but it was Salah, who had not scored for eight games, who provided the moment of magic they desperately required in the 80th minute, racing away to score a majestic solo goal.
It was Salah's 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool and six minutes later Henderson, on as a substitute, wrapped it up with a close-range finish.
Shane Long had made it a nail-biting night for Liverpool's massed ranks of supporters when he fired relegation-threatened Southampton ahead in the ninth minute.
But Liverpool recovered from a surprisingly sluggish start and Naby Keita's header, his first goal for the club, levelled the scores before halftime.
Victory lifted Liverpool to 82 points from 33 games, with City on 80 from 32.
"It was very big. Every game is massive. We've got to win every game. I thought we showed great character in the first half," Henderson told Sky Sports. "It was a big performance in the second half and a big result."
Liverpool needed a stoppage-time winner to beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 at Anfield last weekend and they were forced to do things the hard way again at St Mary's.
They were caught cold early on and Long punished them, calmly firing home after Ryan Bertrand's cross was flicked on.
It could have been worse with Long almost making it 2-0 but Keita's header calmed the nerves in the away ranks.
Liverpool dominated after the break but Southampton defended tenaciously, even if they were lucky when Maya Yoshida appeared to bring down Keita in the penalty area.
With the clock ticking down and Southampton enjoying a brief flurry of pressure, Liverpool broke and Salah drove forward at pace, making around 50 metres without a challenge before firing the ball past Angus Gunn.
Southampton, who remain five points above the drop zone, were flattened and Liverpool were spared any late frights when Roberto Firmino found Henderson who stroked home.
An ecstatic Klopp joined in the celebrations on the pitch with his players who face Chelsea at home next week.
"We have 82 points now, that is massive in this crazy league and everyone is waiting for us. I am really proud. It is incredible," the German said.

BERLIN — A post-game party organised by defender Jerome Boateng is causing quite a stir at Bayern Munich and the champions are hoping they will have something to celebrate after Saturday's crunch Bundesliga match against title rivals Borussia Dortmund.
The Bavarians, who have won the last six league titles, are two points behind Dortmund after their surprise 1-1 draw at Freiburg last week.
They almost slipped up again in the German Cup on Wednesday, squandering leads of 1-0 and 4-2 against second-tier Heidenheim before snatching a 5-4 victory to move into the last four. 
"We need to forget it and delete it," said Bayern sports director Hasan Salihamidzic of the Cup game. "We have a very important game coming up.
"Such games make you think, but we have to focus on Saturday because it is a very important game and we have a lot to do until then."
Victory over Dortmund would put Bayern back in front in the title race while defeat would leave them five points adrift with six matches remaining. Dortmund are on 63 points, with Bayern on 61.
Coupled with their round of 16 Champions League exit to Liverpool, failure to win the league would be mark a hugely disappointing season for the success-spoilt Bavarians. 
Win, lose or draw on Saturday, Bayern's players plan to party at an exclusive Munich nightclub at an event organised by Boateng. 
Informed of Saturday's party plans by reporters, Salihamidzic said he hoped the players would not be distracted. 
"I do not want to interfere in the private life of players but all our focus should be on football," he added.
"As a player I would not do it because you do not yet know what the result will be. I hope we play a game but had he asked me I would have advised against it."
Bayern's central defence has been one of the reasons for their erratic season and conceding four against a second division club after central defender Niklas Suele was sent off will do nothing to boost their confidence.
Dortmund have recovered from their slump in the past two months, earning last-gasp victories in their last two matches.
But their top scorer Paco Alcacer, who struck twice in stoppage-time last week to beat VfL Wolfsburg 2-0, is doubtful after injuring his arm.
"It is difficult to say now who can play on Saturday. The chance is still there for him to play," Dortmund coach Lucien Favre said. "We will have to wait until tomorrow." 
Dortmund could also be without defenders Abdou Diallo and Lukasz Piszczek. A decision will be made after the last training session on Friday.
Dortmund will be without defender Achraf Hakimi and Favre played down the importance of the game.
"Nothing will be decided if we win," he said. "Nothing will be decided if we draw and even if we lose everything is still possible."

LONDON, April 3 — Tottenham Hotspur marked their long-awaited homecoming with a vital 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in the first Premier League game at their new stadium on Wednesday to revive their faltering top-four hopes.
It was hardly a classic to mark the official opening of the spectacular 62,062-seat stadium, but second-half goals by Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen ensured the London club began a new era with a win to move back above Arsenal into third place.
"It's just amazing. What an unbelievable stadium. The noise was just so loud," South Korean Son, whose 12th league goal of the season came in front of the stadium's steepling 17,500-seat single tier South Stand, told Sky Sports.
"To score the first goal at this stadium. White Hart Lane is our history but the new stadium... I can't believe it."
Having moved out of their historic old stadium in May 2017, Tottenham have lodged at Wembley for nearly two seasons after building issues caused a six-month delay to their new arena.
After a couple of test events the official opening was marked by a pre-match ceremony involving a brass band, a school choir and fireworks illuminating the golden cockerel sitting proudly on top of the South Stand.
Tottenham's worst slump in Mauricio Pochettino's five years in charge -- one point from five games -- had seen his side's outside shot at the title replaced by the fear of being swallowed by the chasing pack in the race for a top-four spot.
After failing to get an early breakthrough the anxiety began to show, with Eriksen and Danny Rose both failing to capitalise on chances while Harry Kane had a free kick deflected wide.
It was left to Son, Tottenham's often unsung hero, to break the deadlock and etch his name into the club's history books.
Eriksen did well to win back possession and play in Son on the right and the striker then cut in before firing goalwards -- his shot diverting wickedly off Palace skipper Luka Milivojevic to wrong-foot keeper Vicente Guaita.
With Tottenham's fans finally creating the atmosphere the occasion merited, Kane blazed over before his stumbling run into the area ended with Eriksen sweeping home from close range.
Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris made two superb late saves to spare the fans a nail-biting finale and send them inside to christen the stadium's array of swanky new bars with a crucial win to celebrate.
Victory lifted Spurs back into third spot having been overtaken by local rivals Arsenal at the weekend.
They have 64 points from 32 games with neighbours Arsenal, having played a game less, on 63 along with Chelsea, who beat Brighton & Hove Albion 3-0, while Manchester United are on 61 in the race for Champions League spots.

A look at what's a happening around the majors today:
FINGERS CROSSED
Nationals shortstop Trea Turner will be out indefinitely after breaking his right index finger while trying to bunt. Standing at the plate in the first inning Tuesday night against Philadelphia, Turner squared to bunt versus Zach Elfin. The fastball hit the finger on his right hand, which was wrapped around the bat. Wilmer Difo replaced Turner and will assume the role of starter for the time being.
Meanwhile, Bryce Harper and the Phillies are 4-0 for the first time since 1915, when they opened 8-0 en route to an NL pennant. Harper has been a driving force after signing a $330 million, 13-year deal, crushing his third homer in his first game at Washington since ending his seven-year tenure with the Nationals. He was booed heartily throughout the game — "That's sports," he said — but serenaded by "MVP!" chants after the game by the hundreds of Philly fans.
UPDATE COMING
The Indians may provide a more definitive timetable for Francisco Lindor's return from a sprained left ankle. Lindor visited a specialist Monday, and Cleveland said Tuesday that Lindor would miss more time, but the injury only appears to be a minor setback for the star shortstop. Lindor will meet Wednesday with manager Terry Francona and Chris Antonetti, the club's president of baseball operations, and the Indians might have more info on Lindor's prognosis after that.
DOMINANT DEGROM
NL Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom makes his second start this season for the Mets, this time facing the Marlins. DeGrom is seeking his 31st consecutive start allowing three runs or fewer, already a major league record, after striking out 10 in a thrilling matchup against Washington's Max Scherzer on opening day. DeGrom is 4-6 against the Marlins, who have beaten him more than any other team.
BUILDING AROUND PILLAR
Kevin Pillar is expected to make his first start with the Giants after being acquired Tuesday from the Toronto Blue Jays. Pillar has been one of the AL's best defensive center fielders, a highlight machine nicknamed Superman for his high-flying catches. But he's expected to play more right field for San Francisco in deference to youngster Steven Duggar. Pillar batted .252 with 15 homers last season. The seven-year veteran also has a strong clubhouse reputation.
FLYING HIGH
The Orioles have won four straight, already matching their longest winning streak during a 115-loss 2018 season. They'll try to make it five against Toronto. All the victories have come on the road, Baltimore's first four-game streak away from home since 2016. Nate Karns will take his second turn as an opener — he pitched two scoreless innings against the Yankees on Saturday. Blue Jays righty Matt Shoemaker looks for a second straight strong outing to open the season after shutting down the Tigers last week.

Tottenham will open its billion-dollar stadium on Wednesday, an arena the club hopes will be a catalyst for the revival of its entire neighborhood. But not everyone is certain they will be included in those plans. 
By Rory Smith
LONDON — Standing outside the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar, Ali Demirci pointed, proudly, to the fresh paint on the window frame. Its color was one of those on-trend grays from an upscale catalog, with a name like Elephant’s Breath or Slipper Satin. “The club came and did it,” Demirci said. He glanced upward to the other minor alteration to the shop he owned until a few weeks ago: a bright white sign. “But I installed that myself.”
On the other side of the road, the change has been rather more drastic. The window seats at the Lilywhites Sandwich Bar now offer a view of the gleaming glass frontage of the $1 billion, state-of-the-art stadium that — starting Wednesday evening, when it hosts its inaugural Premier League game — Tottenham Hotspur will call home.
The territory is, of course, familiar: The new stadium is on the same patch of land as the atmospheric, historic, old White Hart Lane, where Spurs played for 118 years. The horizon, though, is different: the club hopes the new stadium represents not just a great leap forward for Spurs — proof, in concrete and steel, that this team belongs among Europe’s pre-eminent powers — but for English soccer as a whole.
Chris Lee, its chief architect, said he had looked at some 300 stadiums around the world for inspiration and incorporated the best elements he could find into what he labeled the “best” stadium on the planet: an arena supposed to be more modern than Wembley, sleeker than Old Trafford, bigger (crucially) than Arsenal’s home at the Emirates. It is supposed to set what Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, described as a “new standard” for sports stadiums.
The arena’s centerpiece is the biggest single-tier stand in England, capable of holding 17,500 fans, modeled on Borussia Dortmund’s Südtribune — known, more commonly, as the Yellow Wall. It claims to be home to the longest bar in Europe. It has a retractable field, allowing it to host not only Premier League matches but N.F.L. games, too. It has its own microbrewery and a restaurant run by a Michelin-starred chef. And, in what is surely a first for a soccer team, Spurs will have its own on-site sommelier.
The appeal for Levy and the club, of course, is the financial boost all of that can bring: more fans, spending more time and more money, all of it flowing straight into the team’s coffers. Levy said Tuesday that, with the extra revenue generated by the stadium, Spurs’ income would be in the world’s top 10.
This is a team that has long had to wheel and deal in the transfer market. On Sunday, the club’s manager, Mauricio Pochettino, admitted he and his staff had laughed at the sight of Naby Keita and Fabinho, £100 million worth of talent combined, on Liverpool’s bench when the teams met, representing a luxury way beyond Spurs’ means. Tottenham’s new home is, in time, supposed to change that, to turn Spurs into a club that can compete with the elite not just on the field, but off it.
The effects of the stadium, though, will resonate beyond Spurs’ balance sheet. The club has long claimed it can be a “catalyst” for the regeneration of the neighborhood around it. At a news media presentation on Tuesday, the club’s executive director, Donna Cullen, opened with a photograph of a burning car: a reminder of the riots that scarred the area — before spreading across the capital and the country — in 2011.
That hot, angry summer, Cullen said, was the “trigger” for Spurs to think about what it could do to improve not only its own horizons, but those of the place it represents. The area around Tottenham, Haringey, is the fifth-most deprived borough in London, she said: The club was taken over by a spirit of “let’s see what we can do.”
The local authority, Haringay Council, does not entirely accept the idea that Tottenham’s rebirth rests on the stadium. Charles Adje, the councilor responsible for regeneration, said he would not use the word “catalyst” himself, but he acknowledged that it “adds value to the area.”
Both the club and the council project that the new stadium could pour around £293 million a year into the local economy; Spurs estimated that it would be responsible for more than 1,700 jobs. “This stadium and this new club is going to make a massive, massive difference to the people of Tottenham,” David Lammy, Tottenham’s member of Parliament, said this week.
That, too, will take time, of course. So far, the main visible differences to Tottenham High Road are the new facades on the sandwich bar, the convenience store and a handful of other properties across from the stadium. The streets running to and from it are, otherwise, much the same as always: a jumble of jerk chicken places and nail bars, Polish supermarkets and tumbledown mechanics.
Smoking a cigarette outside the barbershop he has run for 25 years, Inan Gulecyuz said he was happy to wait. The stadium opening is, technically, bad news for him: Business drops on game days, he said, and with soccer and the N.F.L. to fit in, he will lose a little trade.
That will, he hopes, be offset by the benefits it will bring. “They have changed a lot of the shops just up the road,” he said. “Hopefully the same thing will happen down the road, too.”
A little further from the stadium, Irfan Sahin was serving coffee in Fieldseat, his delicatessen, café, bookshop and organic food market. Soft classical music played overhead.
Sahin said that he expected the stadium to alter the character of the area, to encourage more businesses to open — “There is no other Michelin-starred restaurant in north London,” he noted — but then, he said, Tottenham is changing anyway: In London, gentrification is a constant tide, regardless of where soccer clubs play.
“It is very different from when I first came here in 2001,” he said. “It is slow, of course: We had two gang fights right outside in the last year or so. But there are more places opening all of the time: bars and pubs and cafés and restaurants. It is not as expensive as central London, or as expensive as east London, so it is a good place to open. Hopefully it will be better with the stadium.”
Academic literature is unclear on whether that will hold true. Writing in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in 2000, John Siegfried and Andrew Zimbalist concluded — based largely on case studies in the United States — that while “team owners have argued that sports facilities boost local economic activity, economic reasoning and empirical evidence suggest the opposite.”
There are those in Tottenham, certainly, who feel disenfranchised by the speed of change and by redevelopment proposals backed by the council and the club. 
“There is a real risk of companies going out of business if we cannot find alternative locations in the neighborhood,” said Feruk Tepeyurt, the owner of a local joinery firm and chairman of the Peacock Industrial Estate, home to more than 50 small businesses but, under both the council’s plans and a separate project proposed by the club, scheduled to become a park. “Do we need a park, or do we need a community of small businesses, a lot of them run by local, black and minority ethnic people?”
That is the tension inherent in any regeneration, of course: the issue of who, precisely, it is supposed to work for, of whose needs it is meeting. “There is a thin dividing line between seeing the stadium as a catalyst for regeneration and a Trojan horse for social cleansing,” said Mark Panton, an academic at Birkbeck College who has written extensively on the dispute.
There is one change left to come: Transport for London, the capital’s transit authority, is expected to accept a proposal to rename White Hart Lane, the nearest train station to the stadium, to Tottenham Hotspur.
It is not unprecedented — Arsenal has had its own tube stop, dating to the 1930s — but nor is it universally popular. The objection is based on the idea that erasing the station’s name wipes clean a century or so of history; that it needlessly, ham-fistedly conflates the identities of Tottenham the area and Tottenham the team; that it creates the impression, deep down, below the fresh coats of paint, that the place exists to serve the club, rather than the club existing to reflect the place.

(Reuters) - Ladbrokes owner GVC Holdings Plc on Friday posted an 8 percent growth in quarterly net gaming revenue, as strong online performance in sports and gaming bets offset retail weakness in Britain.
The company reported flat like-for-like retail revenue in the UK for the first quarter ended March 31, but online net gaming revenue rose 17 percent. 
The company, Britain's largest high street bookmaker, has expanded through partnerships and of late has been focusing on the sports-betting and gaming opportunities in the United States.
GVC has weathered regulatory changes, including in the United States where the Justice Department had recently called for wider restrictions on gambling over the internet.
The company said it was confident of achieving its target of double-digit online growth in gaming revenue in 2019.
However, back home in Britain, restrictions on Fixed Odd Betting Terminals was expected to result in the closure of up to a 1,000 shops and impact GVC's 2019 core profit by about 135 million pounds ($176.6 million).
Fixed odds betting terminals are electronic machines in betting shops, which contain a variety of games, including roulette.
The new regulations were implemented in April and maximum betting was limited to 2 pounds ($2.62) from a 100 pounds in an effort to keep a check on problem gambling. 
"We expect it to be several weeks before we can start to assess the impact," Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Alexander said in a statement.
However, the company, which offers sports betting, casino, poker and bingo and has licenses in over 20 countries, was confident of meeting the expectations for its overall full-year core and operating profit. 
Shares of the former FTSE blue-chip component rose 1.9 percent to 594 pence in early trading.

NEW YORK — Garrison Mathews is the kind of player only the most die-hard basketball fans would know, his prolific scoring seldom on any sports highlight clips. With the college basketball spotlight blasted on Madison Square Garden, Mathews put the sport on notice and buried a shot in the clutch that sparked madness for tiny Lipscomb.
Mathews swished his ninth 3-pointer of the game in front of an exuberant Lipscomb bench for the lead with 1:10 left in the game to send the Bisons on their way to the NIT championship in a 71-64 win over Wichita State on Tuesday night.
"It was good to just do it for the team and kind of give us a lift," he said.
He carried them to the NIT final. Lipscomb will face Texas, a 58-44 semifinal winner over TCU, Thursday for the NIT title.
Mathews had been buried in obscurity for the ASUN Conference Bisons (29-7), but put on a show on national television in crunch time at Madison Square Garden. He yelled as the shot fell from beyond NBA 3-point range and the Bisons rose from the bench in jubilation. Mathews sealed the win with free throws and finished with 34 points, setting the stage for Lipscomb to play for its first NIT championship.
"People should know about us by now," forward Rob Marberry said. "I think people can finally see Lipscomb's a basketball school now."
Wichita State's Samajae Haynes-Jones stole the ball near the 3-point line and the 6-foot guard exploded for a fast break dunk that turned MSG yellow and gave the Shockers a late double-digit lead. But they faded down the stretch and one of the hottest second-half teams in basketball missed their final 10 shots and over the final 8-plus minutes to head home empty-handed.
Dexter Dennis scored 13 points and Markis McDuffie had 12 for the Shockers.
The Shockers had a solid season under coach Gregg Marshall, six years after he led the program to the Final Four. Marshall led the Shockers to the 2011 NIT championship, a springboard for the most successful era in program history. The Shockers (22-15) made their own sensational run in the NIT, beating the No. 1, 2 and 3 seeds, all on the road, just to make it to New York.
"This was a year we could have taken a big dip. I mean, a big dip," Marshall said. "But we're in Madison Square Garden playing in April."
The Shockers had their hands full against the fifth-seeded Bisons.
A year after NIT champion Penn State drew big, rowdy crowds to Madison Square Garden, the arena was nearly empty for the matchup between teams from Kansas and Tennessee. New Yorkers wasted their chance to watch Mathews, named to The Associated Press All-America honorable mention team. Mathews was named ASUN player of the year and averaged 26.3 points in the NIT. He entered with a whopping 2,429 career points and scored 44 points in an NIT quarterfinal win over North Carolina State.
He created open looks by moving without the ball and was a burst of energy in Lipscomb's first ever game against the Shockers.
Mathews hit three 3s and scored 18 points in the first half to give Lipscomb a 35-30 lead at the break. The Bisons, who lost the ASUN Tournament championship game to Liberty, looked to Mathews every chance they got. He buried a 3 on a fast break off a turnover to bring the Bisons within one, and even his misses worked in their favor. He missed on a long 3, but Ahsan Asadullah scored on an uncontested tip for a five-point lead.
SOMETHING DIFFERENT
The NIT was a bit of a mad scientist in the college basketball lab. The 3-point line was extended to the same distance used by FIBA (22 feet, 1.75 inches). The free throw lane matched the NBA and was widened from 12 to 16 feet. The shot clock also reset to 20 seconds after an offensive rebound instead of the full 30 seconds, as well as other minor changes.
The experimental rules will help the NCAA determine if a marginally more difficult 3-point shot will be effective for college basketball and if widening the lane will reduce physicality and create more driving opportunities.
"The style of play in men's college basketball is healthy and appealing, but the leadership governing the game is interested in keeping the playing rules contemporary and trending favorably," said Dan Gavitt, NCAA senior vice president of basketball.

Lipscomb: Faces Texas for the NIT title Thursday night at MSG.

Racing has long been a big part of Colton Herta’s family life, so it was not much of a surprise when he took after his IndyCar-driving father and began racing go-karts as a boy.
What was a surprise, to him and everyone else: winning an IndyCar Series race six days before his 19th birthday. Herta, who still lives at home in Southern California with his parents, recently became the youngest winner in the history of the sport’s top level.
Herta led the last 15 laps to win a race on March 24 at Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Tex. It was only his third IndyCar Series race, but the victory was no fluke: He qualified to start fourth in the 24-car field, and he held off the pack after Will Power’s car broke down.
Herta’s father, Bryan, 48, won four races and drove in the Indianapolis 500 five times. He was at the track to call strategy for the scion of another racing family — Marco Andretti, grandson of Mario — and was stunned at how quickly his own son had won a race.
“You’d be foolish to put that kind of expectation on anybody,” Bryan Herta said.
Colton Herta, meanwhile, is tied to a family that made its name in a different sport. One of his car’s owners is George M. Steinbrenner IV, the 22-year-old grandson of George M. Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees from 1973 until his death in 2010.
When Herta took the checkered flag at Austin, Steinbrenner became the youngest owner to win a race in the IndyCar Series. Steinbrenner did not just team up with Herta: The two race buffs have known each other for at least 10 years, Herta said.
“We sort of had the same desire to make it in IndyCar,” said Steinbrenner, whose father, Hank, is a Yankees part-owner and co-chairman. “We thought we could do it together.”
As ecstatic as the team was to win in Austin, Herta said, “It’s kind of a freak situation with how young the team is.”
And it was just the second IndyCar Series race for the team, Harding Steinbrenner Racing.
But Steinbrenner’s partner, Mike Harding, an Indianapolis asphalt and concrete contractor, wasn’t that surprised.
“I think he’s going to be a superstar” owner, Harding said.
Steinbrenner was an intern in 2016 for Bryan Herta’s race team, which won the Indianapolis 500 with Alex Rossi, an American driver.
Steinbrenner learned enough from Herta to realize that he wanted his own race team. With help from Michael Andretti, Marco’s father, Steinbrenner decided to field a car in the Indy Lights second-tier series in 2017. And after two years of racing in Europe, Colton Herta wanted to come back to the United States.
“George probably wouldn’t have hired me if he didn’t think I could win,” Herta said. “He gave me my start. I have a lot of loyalty to him. He’s been good to me.”
Steinbrenner acknowledged that his last name “draws a lot of attention and expectations.” He added: “My family’s history in sports is one of success. That’s a precedent my grandfather set. It’s one that can’t be ignored. It’s what he would expect.”
But he also said, “It would be best for us, still being new to the series, to not shift our focus or expectations too much.”
In the 2017 and 2018 seasons, Herta and Steinbrenner teamed to win six of 33 Indy Lights races, with 20 top-three finishes. Herta won his second Indy Lights race, in St. Petersburg, Fla., and Bryan Herta remembered tearing up after his son’s victory.
Colton Herta drove in one IndyCar Series race last season, finishing 20th among 25 cars. Steinbrenner and Harding became partners last September, with a plan to enter the IndyCar Series full time in 2019.
Herta started 11th but finished eighth in the season opener on March 10 in a road race in St. Petersburg. Herta, Harding and Steinbrenner thought they could do well in the race on the road course at Austin, after they had an encouraging test session there in February. Herta had also driven on the team that won its class in January at the Rolex 24 at Daytona.
Bryan Herta said of his son: “He doesn’t get too up or too down. He’s been very emotionally level his whole life. He’s really good at hitting reset.”
The next IndyCar Series race is Sunday at Barber Motorsports Park in Birmingham, Ala., another road course, and Herta would seem to have a good chance to win again.
The rookie driver and rookie team still need to qualify in May for the sport’s ultimate race, the Indianapolis 500. And the competition in the series remains formidable. The car owned by Bryan Herta and driven by Marco Andretti finished sixth at Austin, 19 seconds off the pace set by Colton Herta.
After Colton’s big win, Bryan Herta said his son was more excited than he had ever seen him as a driver.
Days later, Colton had calmed down. “We realize we’re still coming together as a team,” he said. “We want to make sure it wasn’t a freak incident that happened with winning a race.”

LONDON — As soon as they poured off the Tube at the Seven Sisters stop, the Victoria Line depositing hundreds of fans every minute, they were on autopilot. Heads down through the station, turn left at the top of the escalators, out into the early evening light, and north.
Tottenham Hotspur’s supporters have not walked this way for 689 long days, but they know the route by heart: past Tottenham Green, down the hill, onto the High Road. There, the street once again closed to traffic on matchday, they lingered a little, taking photos of the space-age structure looming above them, marveling at the speed and the scale of change. Now, everything would be different. And yet somehow so familiar was the setting that it all felt the same. Tottenham Hotspur was back home.
That is how the club sees the $1 billion stadium it inaugurated with a 2-0 win against Crystal Palace on Wednesday night: not so much a move as a return; new and gleaming and modern, but somehow in keeping with tradition, too, a fusion of the future and the past.
“We are home,” the club’s announcer said before the start of a brief opening ceremony. There was genuine emotion in his voice. Thousands of flags, emblazoned with the slogan “Welcome Home,” fluttered in the stands.
It is not quite that simple, of course. Those thousands of fans making the journey down the Seven Sisters Road have been waiting for this moment throughout their club’s long exile at Wembley: the day when they would step once again on familiar territory, when they might retrace the steps of more than a century, when they would be back where they belong.
They started arriving early, filling first the streets and then the stands hours before kickoff, not just savoring the occasion, but getting their bearings, too. They needed to work out how long the lines for security would take. They wanted to sample the bars, to find their seats, to take in the view, to try out the acoustics. The grid reference and the postal code might be the same, but the mechanics of a matchday, necessarily, could not be. A house does not become a home overnight.
That this stadium — named, for now, after the club — is beautiful is not in question. As part of the design process, Tottenham’s chairman, Daniel Levy, and Chris Lee of Populous, the stadium’s architects, visited hundreds of stadiums around the world: not just those that house soccer teams, but arenas that host other sports, too.
They tried to incorporate elements from those that impressed them into Tottenham’s new facility: the stadium’s centerpiece, the vast bank of its South Stand, owes a nod of inspiration not just to the Kop stands traditional in England but — as has been much trumpeted in the last few years — to the Yellow Wall at Borussia Dortmund, widely regarded as the most intimidating grandstand in Europe.
To an inexpert eye, though, there were plenty of other references: the curved lines of the stands are redolent of Olympique Marseille’s Stade Velodrome, redesigned for the 2016 European Championship, and Benfica’s Estadio da Luz; the sense of proximity to the field, of fans towering over the players, is something that would be familiar to anyone who has been to La Bombonera, where Boca Juniors play; there is an echo in the layout, too, of the Allianz Arena, home of Bayern Munich.
Those stadiums are all very different, but they are united by the reputation they have for boisterous, deafening atmospheres, the holy grail of any modern arena. Something in their design — either deliberate or by chance — captures and traps noise. It washes down on to the field and swirls around the air. It enhances the experience not just for the fans in attendance, but for those watching on, living vicariously, at home.
Levy and Lee wanted Tottenham to lay claim to the finest stadium in the world, a place where fans wanted to spend time — and, as a consequence, money — before and after the whistle. They took care to give the place a sheen of luxury, making sure everything from the toilets to the food were a level above anything a visitor might find elsewhere.
But they knew, too, that what makes a stadium great is not just the quality of its finish but the feeling it engenders; they wanted to infuse it with a little of the magic that of Dortmund and Munich and Marseille, designing not just something to take the breath away, but a place to make fans scream their lungs hoarse.
Though design is a part of that — as anyone who has been to the many soulless bowls on the outskirts of English market towns would testify — it is not something that can be created out of nothing. Atmosphere cannot be boiled down to an equation: this many fans multiplied by this much gradient divided by this distance to the field.
It is something organic, something that develops over months and years, a composite of the character of the crowds and the experiences they have lived through, the memories they share, and the nature of and expectations on the team. It does not appear out of the ether.
Spurs have done all they can to help that process along. At the end of the opening ceremony, with the teams on the field — and Crystal Palace’s players looking entirely baffled by the whole farrago — the camera focused in on Harry Kane, Tottenham’s captain and totem. He was gazing out at the stands, wearing the stoic but proud look of a father watching a child graduate. Well, he might: he has waited long enough to see this day, and he had good reason to be pleased with the results. The place is everything Spurs hoped, and promised, it would be.
It is not, though, everything it will be, not yet. It was never going to be, not on its opening night. Spurs are back where they have always been, at the end of that long and familiar walk, left out of Seven Sisters and north, up the High Road. The setting is the same. The backdrop is comforting. But the building is different; still, for now, a house, not yet a home.

Horse racing is among America’s oldest sports and perhaps the only one ever run out of the White House: Andrew Jackson operated a stable there during his presidency. Yet the multibillion-dollar industry is reeling as the Kentucky Derby approaches, with the death of yet another thoroughbred at the premier Santa Anita Park in California amplifying anxiety over whether the sport will continue in the state.
On Sunday, a gelding named Arms Runner fell during a race, sustaining a catastrophic injury to its right front leg that required the horse to be euthanized. It was the 23rd equine fatality since Dec. 26, and it came on only the third day of racing at the track since it had halted competition on March 5.
“I’m concerned about the publicity we’ve been getting,” said Bob Baffert, the Hall of Fame trainer who won the Triple Crown  with American Pharoah in 2015 and with Justify last year. “This is our March Madness. But we’re having the wrong kind of madness. We feel like we’re all under the gun. We should be under the gun. You can’t defend a horse getting hurt.”
The track, in Arcadia, Calif., northeast of Los Angeles, had been closed to study why it had become so deadly, as well as to begin putting in place aggressive, wide-ranging drug and safety protocols. The spike was startling considering that in 2017, there were 20 deaths in a total of 8,463 starts over a span of 122 racing days at Santa Anita, according to Jockey Club data.
The racetrack, however, will remain open after the most recent fatality and on Saturday will host one of its signature races, the Santa Anita Derby, an important steppingstone for 3-year-old horses hoping to line up for the Kentucky Derby on May 4.
“We know what the stakes are and understand that we might be the place that kills horse racing in California,” said Tim Ritvo, chief operating officer of the Stronach Group, which owns the track. “Yes, we are worried, but we are confident that the track is safe and have gone the extra mile on rules that put us more in line with the rest of the world. We got to keep our doors open.”
The horse deaths have become a rallying point for the animal rights movement, which is particularly strong in California, where it would take 600,000 signatures on a petition to prompt a ballot initiative on whether horse racing should continue to exist. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has asked Gov. Gavin Newsom to form an independent panel to investigate how the track, breeders, owners, trainers, jockeys and veterinarians treat the horses.
“The veterinarians and trainers and track have not done all that they can to protect the horses,” said Kathy Guillermo, a PETA vice president.
Representative Judy Chu, Democrat of California, wants Congress to examine the racetrack, which is in her district, and the sport in general. The Los Angeles District Attorney’s Office has already begun an investigation.
But the uproar resonates far beyond California. With nearly $12 billion bet annually at North American racetracks and more than a $1 billion generated in breeding sheds and sales auctions, a ban on thoroughbred racing, or even a serious blow to the sport, could put tens of thousands of people out of work.
“I think it’s pretty depressing and fraught with danger for the sport,” said Stuart Janney III, the chairman of the Jockey Club and a breeder and owner of the 2013 Kentucky Derby champion, Orb. “But I also think it is the valley we have to pass through to get to a better place. We can’t let these tragedies be in vain.”
There has been plenty of recrimination. Trainers and owners have accused Ritvo and the Stronach Group of cutting costs and prodding them to run their horses more often so there will be fuller fields and more revenue.
The Stronach Group recently established restrictions on medications and a ban on whips, moves implying that blame rested on trainers and owners for unsavory practices in the pursuit of purse money. The restrictions include banning the use of Lasix, a diuretic that is used to stop pulmonary bleeding but that has also been found to enhance performance, and increasing the limits on legal therapeutic anti-inflammatories, joint injections, shock wave therapy and anabolic steroids.
“Maybe we are where we are because racing has become too much of a business and not enough of a sport,” Ritvo said.
No one expects the scrutiny to let up. The Louisville Courier-Journal last week proclaimed Churchill Downs, the home of the Kentucky Derby, one of the “deadliest racetracks in America.” The newspaper reported that the track had lost 43 thoroughbreds to racing injuries since 2016, an average of 2.42 per 1,000 starts, which was 50 percent higher than the national average during the same span.
The Jockey Club’s Janney said the sport needed to break free of some of its history in order survive.
For decades, horse racing has experienced spikes in fatalities without adopting significant changes. The Horseracing Integrity Act of 2019 was introduced in Congress last month by Representatives Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, and Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky. The bill would create a private, independent authority responsible for developing and administering a nationwide antidoping and medication control program for horse racing.
“I think it has a better chance to pass today,” Janney said. “Every sport, every industry, has to change with the times. This is a scary time, but every undertaking is a result of getting a glimpse at the downside of staying where you are.”
Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the date of this year’s Kentucky Derby. It is May 4, not May 2.

Close your eyes and try to imagine your wedding proposal.
If you think you’re not really the marrying type, then imagine an alternative proposal — asking someone on a date or to the prom? (Did you know there was such a thing as a promposal?)
What did you see: a beautiful setting? Candles? Rose petals? Are you down on one knee? Is there a ring?
Now add 50,000 cheering people to your fantasy. Would that make the moment more special?
Does the idea of a Jumbotron proposal fill you with romantic delight or deep, cringy fear? (You can watch two examples here and here.)
In “Thinking of a Jumbotron Proposal? Some Say, Ugh. Others, Say Yes.,” Britni de la Cretaz writes:
Jumbotron proposals have become as much a part of baseball as the seventh-inning stretch — no matter that they are often considered tacky and in bad taste.
When a proposal appears on the giant screen, a large segment of sports Twitter world (mostly women) chime in about how they hope no one ever proposes to them at a sporting event. Still, hundreds of these public, grandiose gestures happen every year and many proposees walk out of the stadium happily ever after.
On March 31, 2018, Joanna Chan, who works for Netflix, proposed to her girlfriend of five years, Julie Morris, who is employed at Hulu. The moment happened during the first period of a Calgary Flames game and was shown on the giant screen at Scotiabank Saddledome — known as the Enmax Energy Board — home to the National Hockey League’s Flames.
Ms. Chan and Ms. Morris, both 36 and living in Los Angeles (since married and now both going by Chan-Morris), had just embarked on a five-year tour of all 31 N.H.L. arenas, and the Saddledome was their final stop.
Joanna Chan-Morris says that a few stops before their final one, she knew she wanted to propose in Calgary. “It’s not about the public aspect of the proposal, really,” she said. “It was really just about making that last game special.”
Even still, with that gesture, their engagement became a viral sensation, traveling beyond the area and onto the internet. Joanna paid 5,000 Canadian dollars ($3,782) for the opportunity, which she says was “worth every penny.”
The Saddledome is far from the only sports arena that gives fans the option to propose on a really big TV screen in front of thousands. Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox, does 50 to 60 live, in-game proposals each season at a cost of $350 each. At Dodger Stadium, getting engaged onscreen will set you back $5,000, an event the team estimates happens two or three times a season.
The article continues:
The whole concept irks Jessica Kleinschmidt, a content producer/reporter at NBC Sports Bay Area and a self-proclaimed “hater of in-game proposals.”
“It’s as if this person needs to show these complete strangers they love this person by making a show out of it,” Ms. Kleinschmidt said. “Needing validation from complete strangers? Go on Twitter if you want to do that.”
Also, she noted, an in-game proposal “puts the woman under pressure to say yes.”
When those traditional gender dynamics are reversed, the public response can be cruel.
In 2014, a woman surprised her boyfriend by proposing to him at an N.B.A. game. At the time, she told Fox 5 DC, “I thought this would make me the best wife-to-be ever to do it in front of his favorite team.” Her fiancé seemed happy she asked. But the response online was less than kind, with the frequently misogynist sports and culture website Barstool Sports calling it “the absolute worst proposal of all time,” among other worse things. Another blogger wrote that he would “never want to be proposed to by my girlfriend, and at an N.B.A. game no less, not in a million years.”
When Jumbotron proposals go wrong, spectators take an almost perverse pleasure in the rejection. In 2017, a rejected proposal at Fenway Park resulted in the entire ballpark chanting, “She said no!” (Jasmine Guillory’s newest novel, aptly named “The Proposal,” opens with a rejected proposal at Dodger Stadium that goes viral on the internet.)
This virality is something that more and more Jumbotron proposers are experiencing now that social media is a thing and everyone in the stadium has a smartphone, or the teams broadcast feel-good content across their various platforms.
What is it about our culture’s ideas about love, romance and marriage that allowed the phenomenon to gain traction in the first place? “Romantic comedies,” Chloe Angyal wrote for Buzzfeed in 2015, “teach us that the truer a true love is, the grander and more public the public grand gesture will be.”
Students, read the entire article, then tell us:
— What do you think about Jumbotron proposals? Would you like to receive or make one yourself? Why or why not? Did the article change your views on these over-the-top proposals?
— What are the best Jumbotron or public proposals you’ve ever seen or heard of, whether live or online? Do you find them charming and delightful, or do they make you uncomfortable? Do you ever watch Jumbotron proposal fails for fun? If yes, why?
— Do you know if one of your parents proposed or not? Is there a story that went with it?
— What would be your ideal marriage proposal? Would you want to be proposed to in some elaborate way? Why or why not? What proposal ideas do you have? What dos and don’ts for success might you suggest? (You can look at some other creative proposals here.)
— If you hate the idea of a big fancy proposal, how do you feel about marriage itself? Do you ever think about it? Is a wedding proposal too old fashioned or simply too far in the future to imagine? Do you think we place too much emphasis on romantic gestures — rings, engagement parties, lavish weddings and the like?

WASHINGTON — Showered by raindrops and jeers for much of the game, Bryce Harper put a bat-flipping, celebratory finish on his memorable return to Washington.
Harper crushed a long home run in his final at-bat, and the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Nationals 8-2 Tuesday night for the franchise's best start in over a century.
Maikel Franco also homered for the Phillies, baseball's only undefeated team at 4-0. They had only done that in 1915 and 1897.
Harper left Washington after playing 927 games over seven years, participating in six All-Star Games and winning the 2015 NL MVP Award. He listened to what the Nationals had to offer, then signed a $330 million, 13-year contract with the rival Phillies in February.
Harper hasn't wasted any time providing returns for the investment. He has three homers and five RBIs in four games, along with a .429 batting average. He drove in three Tuesday.
Booed during every at-bat, Harper thumped a "take that," 458-foot shot in the eighth inning off Jeremy Hellickson. As the ball soared toward the second deck in right field, Harper flipped his bat and circled the bases with delight before celebrating with his new teammates in the visiting dugout.
"It's the emotion of the game. That's it. That's about it," he said of the bat flip.
But man, that home run sure felt good.
"I was pretty fired up. I was excited," he said. "I was trying to get back to my teammates as quick as possible and do all my handshakes."
When Philadelphia's starting lineup was announced during the late stages of a 41-minute rain delay, it became apparent that Harper would not be welcomed back warmly. Many in the slow-arriving crowd of 35,920 booed loudly when his name was announced as the No. 3 hitter, and the derisive shouting continued during a video montage of his biggest moments with the Nationals.
"I heard the boos," Harper acknowledged. "For me, that's part of sports, part of the game."
The chorus resumed when Harper walked to the plate in the first inning to face three-time Cy Young Award winner Max Scherzer. The fans finally cheered when Harper took a strike on the outside corner, and they got even louder when Harper whiffed on a 2-2 changeup .
"Hearing the boos in the first at-bat just reminded me that I have 45,000 people back in Philadelphia screaming for me," Harper said.
When he took his position in right field, Harper stood in front of seven fans wearing white shirts that spelled out T-R-A-I-T-O-R.
After striking out twice, Harper doubled to right in the fifth and singled in a run in the sixth to make it 6-0 before connecting in the eighth.
When the game ended, hundreds of Phillies fans remained, chanting "MVP! MVP!" as Philadelphia shook hands. The shouting fans included many who had bused in from Philly earlier in the day and sat behind Harper in right field.
Jean Segura had three hits and three RBIs for the Phillies, who were coming off a season-opening sweep of Atlanta.
Zach Eflin (1-0) struck out nine and allowed three hits over five scoreless innings. He outdid Scherzer (0-2), who allowed one earned run in five innings and struck out nine.
Scherzer has started half the Nationals' four games this season. He has a 2.13 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 12 2/3 innings, but Washington has yet to score a run for him.
Very little went right for the Nationals, who fell to 1-3.
Shortstop Trea Turner left in the first inning after being struck by a pitch on his right index finger while trying to bunt. Turner squared at the plate and couldn't back away from a fastball that struck his hand, which was wrapped around the bat.
The injury was diagnosed as a nondisplaced fracture. The timetable for his return is undetermined.
In addition, first baseman Matt Adams left in the fourth inning with back spasms, likely the result of a scary fall early in the game while chasing a foul ball. Drifting behind first base toward the stands, Adams flipped over a fence as he reached into the photo well and landed on his back.
Manager Dave Martinez said Adams was day to day.
Anthony Rendon hit a two-run homer in the sixth.
DOMINATED
Philadelphia cleanup hitter Rhys Hoskins went 0 for 3 with two strikeouts against Scherzer and is 0 for 14 with nine Ks lifetime against the right-hander.
STRANGE PERSPECTIVE
Speaking before the game, Harper had no doubt that this was going to be an unusual experience.
"Seeing Max on the mound tonight, Trea at short, Rendon at third and me not standing behind them, it's definitely going to be weird," Harper said. "But I'm looking forward to running out there and doing my job for the Philadelphia Phillies. I'm excited for that next chapter."
TRAINER'S ROOM
Phillies: LHP Tommy Hunter, on the 10-day injured list with a strained right forearm, was getting "a series of tests" in Philadelphia on Tuesday, manager Gabe Kapler said. "He still felt some soreness," Kapler said, "so we want to make sure that we don't miss anything."
Nationals: OF/INF Howie Kendrick (hamstring strain) was in the clubhouse Tuesday and appears close to being activated from the injured list. "He's going to work out with us a couple days and we'll see where he's at," Martinez said, adding that a rehabilitative stint might not be necessary. ... OF Michael A. Taylor (knee/hip) will start a rehab assignment Friday with Double-A Harrisburg.
UP NEXT
Phillies: Aaron Nola (1-0, 1.50 ERA) starts in the finale of the two-game series on Wednesday afternoon. The right-hander beat Atlanta in the opener after going 17-6 last year.
Nationals: Anibal Sanchez makes his Nationals debut on Wednesday.

The tales of Zion Williamson’s feats did not begin when he arrived at Duke. They probably won’t end there, either.

Zion Williamson’s legend grows with every game these days, with each new thundering dunk and every stunning new feat of elevation. It has been this way for several years now, with Williamson the featured actor in a growing collection of viral clips that show a player with the skills to outrun almost anyone, to catch almost anything, to challenge almost anybody. Even his lowest moments — the sneaker that couldn’t hold him, the injured knee that cost him five games — have somehow morphed into highlights. But Williamson, an 18-year-old Duke freshman, has been making memorable moments for years. A group of New York Times reporters tracked down some of the people who were present for a few of them, to ask them about the memories that stand out the most.
By Kevin Armstrong
Forgive Tom Konchalski.
The publisher of High School Basketball Illustrated first observed Zion Williamson in person at the Elite 24, an all-star showcase for the nation’s top prep prospects, on Aug. 20, 2016. The court at Pier 2 in Brooklyn Bridge Park was the stage, and Williamson was 10 for 10 from the field, scored 23 points and shared most valuable player honors. Konchalski was impressed.
To Konchalski’s well-trained eye — in five decades he had amassed an inventory of reports that stretched from Michael Jordan to LeBron James — Williamson, who had just turned 16, appeared to be an interior technician, a player at ease turning on his defender to make it to the rim for understated finishes. Because of Williamson’s body type, Konchalski considered him a left-handed Jamal Mashburn, a reference to the beefy Bronx product who played 11 seasons in the N.B.A.
When Konchalski sat down at his typewriter after the Elite 24 to describe Williamson’s effort, he wrote that the “6-foot-5 junior Zion Williamson, the master of quiet domination, provided a bit of fresh air.”
Looking back, Konchalski says now, he got it all wrong.
“I’m wiping off copious amounts of egg from my face,” he said. Williamson, he knows, “is anything but quiet.”

The first time LeBron James showed up to watch Zion Williamson, they wouldn’t let him in the door.
It was July 2017, and James, once a transcendent teenage talent himself, went to see Williamson, the next big thing, at a showcase in Las Vegas. Williamson’s team, South Carolina Supreme, was playing Big Baller Brand, which featured LaMelo Ball, a brother of Lakers guard Lonzo Ball. It was, by summer youth basketball standards, a must-see event.
James, of course, wasn’t the only one interested in that confluence of basketball stardust. The N.B.A. players Damian Lillard, Andrew Wiggins, Jamal Murray and Thon Maker were in the gym by the time James arrived, adding buzz to a crowd of more than 4,000 that threatened to swamp a court configured to hold less than half that many.
Even in warm-ups, the excitement was palpable. The fans oohed and aahed as Williamson tossed balls high in the air and dunked them; many spectators held cellphones, the better to share video clips of a scene that was quickly called the “craziest A.A.U. game ever.” 
But James never saw any of it. With fans standing a dozen deep, nearly spilling onto the court from every direction, he and his group were told that just letting him into the gym constituted a security risk. A teenager’s mere presence, it seemed, had squeezed out basketball’s biggest star. James was told he couldn’t come in.
“We shut him down,” an Adidas marketing executive told CBS Sports at the time. “The corners were 500 deep. That’s where it got insane.” 
It would be a year and a half before James got to see Williamson play in person. In February, he took a 35-minute flight from Philadelphia to Charlottesville, Va., and watched from courtside as Williamson, playing for Duke, went for 18 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a win against Virginia. Williamson’s athleticism, James declared, was “ridiculous.”

Bishop Richardson was averaging about three alley-oop assists to Williamson every game when their team, Spartanburg (S.C.) Day School, arrived at Ben Lippen School in Columbia, S.C., for a game during Williamson’s junior year. 
Williamson dunked a lot back then, and he had recorded at least two slams in the first half that had the gym rocking. “I remember it vividly,” Williamson said last week. “Their student section was really into the game, talking a lot.”
The real highlight, though, was still to come. With Spartanburg ahead by 39 points, Richardson, a spindly guard who had played varsity since the eighth grade, found himself jogging easily up the right sideline when he spotted Williamson closing menacingly down the other side of the court. He tried another lob; he knew the pass didn’t have to be perfect.
“If you threw it anywhere near the rim,” Richardson said, “he was going to get it.” 
On this occasion, Richardson’s toss arrived well below the rim. But that enabled Williamson to do something outrageous: He rose into the air, reached out with two hands to grab the incoming pass at about shoulder height, and — still rising, now high enough to peer inside the rim he was about to shake — used one sweeping, circular motion to bring the ball down to his waist and then back up to the left side of his body before ramming it through the basket with his left hand.
The crowd erupted. 
“I remember thinking, ‘Holy cow, I’ve never seen anyone do anything like that, let alone be a part of it,’” Richardson said. “People were falling out of the bleachers.”
The dunk made it onto highlight reels and national sports shows within hours, but Richardson did not see a replay until the next day, when he and teammates sneaked a peek in a study hall.
“I wish I could take credit for it,” Richardson said, “but it was completely accidental.”

Vertical leap is measured using a simple contraption: a tall pole with a series of long, metal fingers that project horizontally from it on top of one another — narrow wings stacked up, up, up, at consistent increments. It may seem lo-fi, but it is also foolproof: Your vertical reach while jumping is the highest metal flange you are able to bat away from its set position. Subtract standing vertical reach from that number, and you have a player’s vertical leap. 
When Duke put its players through the test one day last summer, Zion Williamson’s vertical leap was measured at 46 inches. But to the teammates and Duke staff members who were present, mere numbers do not do the moment justice.
“We were all in shock,” the sophomore guard Alex O’Connell said. 
Williamson, who went last, was off the charts. On his first attempt, he casually swatted aside the highest measurement. A staff member adjusted the pole to its highest setting and reset the tabs, and Williamson repeated the feat. They put weights under the contraption to lift it a few more inches into the air. Williamson batted the highest measurements aside again. 
“It was something you don't see a lot, especially with a guy who is built like him flying through the air,” forward Javin DeLaurier said. “It's a sight to behold.”
Nolan Smith, an assistant coach who played for four years at Duke and several more in the N.B.A. and Europe, said he had never seen anything like it. Cam Reddish, another Blue Devils’ freshman, said he missed out; he said he was in another part of the building when Williamson tested the test itself. 
“I just heard that he broke the record,” Reddish said. “Zion things.”

In the beginning, the former Duke standout Jay Williams kept track of the Williamson hype the same way everybody else did: through low-quality video clips shot in high school gyms and then posted on the internet. Williamson’s high-flying plays quickly became “the eighth wonder of the world,” Williams said.
Then he saw him in person. 
“I have never seen a player casually do a 360 in a game,” Williams said of seeing Williamson do precisely that in a game against Clemson this season. “Even when you saw Vince do it in college,” he said, referring to Vince Carter, who played at the University of North Carolina, “there was a level of oomph that he needed to exert that type of energy. My man casually did it in the game. He did a 360 like I would do a layup.”
Williams said plays like that one were the reason comparing Williamson to other basketball players is a mistake. 
“To me, I was looking at a football player who had the finesse of basketball ability,” he said. “I’ve never seen that before. I played against Julius Peppers in college. I remember him being the only guy Carlos Boozer was somewhat intimidated to go against because he couldn’t just move him around. I remember thinking for the first time: ‘Oh, I was looking at Julius Peppers but through a basketball lens. What? What?’ Julius was agile, but I am talking about the frame of the body. It reminded me of a linebacker or a tight end. Just different.”

Spike Lee was in his seat and Barack Obama was settled in his, down past the end of the Duke bench. But in front of North Carolina’s Luke Maye — in the space where Zion Williamson had stood a moment earlier — there was suddenly … nothing. 
“I didn’t hear anything, man,” Maye said Thursday. 
What everyone quickly realized was that the story had quickly changed from a heated rivalry game — top-ranked Duke vs. No. 8 North Carolina — into something far more bizarre: Williamson’s Nike sneaker had broken apart as he made a move at the free-throw line. He was down. North Carolina was racing upcourt. And everyone else was asking: What just happened? 
Maye, in that moment, had the best seat in the house. 
“I just took the ball,” he said, “and just started going.”
Initially, the Blue Devils were just as confused. The first thing Duke’s Javin DeLaurier saw from his spot on the bench was the sneaker on Williamson’s left foot, or what was left of it, anyway: Its sole was flapping free, like a banner in the wind.
To DeLaurier, this counted as good news.
“I was like, ‘Oh, no, it’s just his shoe,’” he said. “There was a sigh of relief.”
He had, after all, seen this before. He had blown out a shoe before. He had seen Williamson do it, too. “Zion’s a big human being, moving pretty fast, changing direction,” DeLaurier said. “It happens.”

“I consider it my fault,” De’Andre Hunter says now.
He’s not wrong. Late in a February game at Virginia, Cavaliers guard Kyle Guy whipped the ball crosscourt to his teammate De’Andre Hunter, who waited at the 3-point line, deep in the corner, and without a Duke player within 15 feet of him. Williamson was on the left side of the court, playing his usual feisty, active defense, so Hunter, in the right corner, took his time uncoiling the 3-point attempt.
Williamson, though, had closed the gap by then. Soaring across the court with five quick steps, he took off from about six feet away just as Hunter unloaded. “I consider it my fault,” Hunter said. “I took way too long setting it up and releasing the shot. But he came a long way.” 
In fact, Williamson jumped so high and stretched so vertically that his right hand was well above the height of the 10-foot rim when he cleanly swatted Hunter’s shot into the stands. 
“He just came out of nowhere,” Hunter said. 
Worse news, at least for Hunter, was that the clip made its way to ESPN’s “SportsCenter” and other highlight shows, and it is now a staple of the Williamson YouTube filmography. 
“I didn’t know it was going to be such a big deal,” Hunter said recently.

For car shoppers in the market for a luxury electric vehicle, until recently there was just one name around: Tesla.
That company’s near-monopoly in luxury electrics in the United States is about to change. Several months ago, Jaguar introduced its first electric model, the I-Pace sport utility vehicle. Within the next 12 months, rival electrics will be available from Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volvo.
In addition to Jaguar’s I-Pace, the Audi E-tron S.U.V. can now be reserved and will ship next month. Mercedes’s EQC sport utility vehicle is due in 2020. Porsche’s electric Taycan sports car will arrive at the end of this year; prospective buyers can register now to make a deposit. Volvo’s Polestar 2 five-door fastback will ship in 2020.
And if you can believe the press releases, this herd will be followed next year in the United States by luxury electric offerings from lesser-known companies. Byton will unveil its M-Byte S.U.V. in China at the end of this year and in the States in late 2020. And Rivian expects to begin production of its electric truck and S.U.V. next year; the company recently announced a $700 million investment led by Amazon.
The established carmakers are plotting to dominate the luxury electric field, taking market share away from Tesla. While Tesla owners can be fervent, the vehicles continue to exhibit supposed poor workmanship and endure long repair times. In February, the Model 3 lost its Consumer Reports “recommended” rating because of what the testing organization said were reliability issues.
The market, then, is ripe for the taking, and the major luxury carmakers are eager to swoop in, hoping to trade on their reputations for high performance luxury and reliability.
Despite their headfirst jump into what will soon be a crowded field, there is no definitive proof that the electric market is growing. Tesla still accounts for only a small fraction of all vehicles sold.
Yet Audi, for one, expects that by 2025 it will have 12 all-electric models generating 30 percent of its sales worldwide. By next year, every Jaguar or Land Rover vehicle will have some form of electrification, whether all-electric or hybrid.
Audi believes it can succeed because “people want the future,” said Scott Keogh, president of its parent company, Volkswagen of America. “The business is always looking for what’s new.”
He added: “Something’s in the air, and people don’t want to be left behind. We’re building something with a cool factor.”
That cool factor could scare away customers if they’re not prepared for a different ownership experience. For instance, they should expect to spend thousands more for a “Level 2” home charger, because a standard 120-volt wall outlet provides no more than five miles of charge every hour. A Level 2 charger raises that figure to around 20 miles every hour, an amount that manufacturers say is adequate, given that an owner will typically charge a vehicle overnight.
Amazon is working with Audi to install Level 2 chargers; prices range from $1,400 to over $4,000, depending on the age of a home’s electrical panel. An electrician can also tackle this job.
Most commercial pay-as-you-go chargers are also Level 2, meaning that they’re practical only if you can plug in most of the day at work. Electric vehicle owners will get little benefit from plugging into free Level 2 chargers in front of supermarkets and other stores for the short time they’re shopping.
DC Fast Chargers, which can add up to 240 miles of range per hour on today’s models, are few and far between; the closest to my Los Angeles suburb is a 15-minute drive. And a location often has only one or two charge points, which means you might have to wait to use it.
A DC Fast Charger can charge the coming Mercedes EQC to 80 percent from 10 percent in 40 minutes and Audi’s E-tron to 80 percent of its 204-mile range in 30 minutes. Audi will give E-Tron owners the equivalent of 2,000 miles of free charging at Electrify America locations.
The next generation of electric vehicles will charge even faster. A 350-kilowatt DC Fast Charger will be able to charge Porsche’s Taycan to 240 miles in 16 minutes. The company will give Taycan buyers three years of free 30-minute charging at Electrify America locations, some of which will have 350-kilowatt outlets. Porsche dealerships will also have a mix of 50-kilowatt and 350-kilowatt chargers.
While shorter on range than most gasoline-powered vehicles, electric vehicles accelerate rapidly. Audi claims its E-tron will travel from zero to 60 miles an hour in 5.5 seconds, as will Byton’s all-wheel-drive version. Mercedes’s EQC will accelerate from zero to 60 in 4.9 seconds, Jaguar’s I-Pace in 4.5 seconds and Porsche’s Taycan in less than 3.5 seconds.
“The I-Pace gives me everything without compromise,” said David Larsen, director of product planning for Jaguar Land Rover North America. With an electric vehicle, “there’s no gear shift,” he said. “You’d have to go to a Jaguar F-Pace SVR with 550 horsepower to get this performance.”
These vehicles are not cheap. Not including the current $7,500 federal tax credit, starting prices range from $63,000 for Volvo’s Polestar 2 to the mid-$100,000 range for variants of the Taycan. Audi’s E-tron costs between $75,000 and $82,000, and the I-Pace starts at $69,500.
At that price, expect the vehicles to offer the latest technology. The EQC will come with Mercedes’s new all-digital MBUX touch screen. It responds to voice, touch and hand gestures, recognizing whether the driver or passenger is making a request, calculating routes based on available charge and preheating the interior.
The E-tron offers Audi’s updated touch-screen system and is the first vehicle to integrate Amazon’s Alexa voice control system. The screen can display a virtual overhead view of the vehicle, as well as a virtual 360-degree image as if the E-tron were viewed from a distance. Cameras will detect road signs, and a display will keep the driver apprised of what was posted even if the driver missed them. In select cities, the vehicle will indicate when a light will change to green and advise the proper speed to avoid red lights.
Volvo’s Polestar 2 will embed Google Maps and Google Assistant with the vehicle, rather than require that these apps be downloaded on a connected smartphone. Its phone-as-key technology will sense the driver’s approach and unlock the doors.
Byton’s Shared Experience Display is an all-video dashboard that stretches 48 inches across the interior, and it responds to hand gestures. It can show performance, navigation and entertainment features. The vehicle also has a video tablet in the steering wheel and another in the center console.
To help consumers understand what electric vehicles can do, LA CoMotion, an annual conference focusing on the future of transportation and cities, is sponsoring CoMo3000, an electric vehicle rally from New York to Los Angeles that will feature pro, amateur and celebrity drivers.
“We want to dispel the idea of range anxiety, and show that electric vehicles are sexy and fun,” said John Rossant, CoMotion’s founder.
To get ready for their introductions, manufacturers are retraining thousands of sales employees to understand the new electric landscape.
But buyers still need to do their homework. At a recent electric vehicle introduction at a local high-end dealership, two sales employees offered completely different answers as to charging times and the driving range for their new luxury offering.
“Training is continuing, and we’re getting up to speed,” said Loren Angelo, Audi’s vice president for marketing.

With riders galloping their horses toward obstacles the size of S.U.V.s and then suddenly turning, show jumping is a sport of timing and finesse, but it’s not for the faint of heart.
“There’s obviously a danger aspect of it,” said Elizabeth Madden, who will defend her individual show jumping title at the F.E.I. World Cup Finals  to be held in Goteborg, Sweden, from Thursday to Sunday. “You have a 1,300-pound animal that could fall on you if you fall. And if you’re jumping 1.6 meters, you’re up in the air pretty high.”
But Madden, who is known as Beezie, says she doesn’t think about the danger and instead focuses on the course and on communicating clearly with her horse.
“It all depends on the horse you’re on and having a lot of confidence in the partnership,” she said. “That’s something that’s not normal in other sports.”
Madden, 55, grew up in the Milwaukee area and rode in her first grand prix in 1985. She has represented the United States in four Olympic Games (winning two golds, a silver and a bronze) and at multiple world championships and international competitions. She’s won the World Cup final twice: on Simon in 2013 and again in 2018 on Breitling LS.
“She’s won everything the sport has to offer,” said Robert Ridland, the chef d’équipe of the United States Equestrian Team. “She’s one of our legendary riders of all time.”
Madden regularly rides four horses in the grand prix competitions, but she will return to the World Cup on Breitling LS. She has ridden the 13-year-old bay stallion, owned by Abigail Wexner, since he was 7 and has brought him up through the levels of competition.
“He’s a little bit of a sensitive horse,” Madden said. She prefers that type of personality and deals with it well.
“Breitling doesn’t want to touch the fences,” said John Madden, her husband and coach, who leads the team managing their horses.
“It takes a really expert rider to make sure that he can jump those high fences without touching them and getting scared,” John Madden said. Walking into the arena, “you want him to feel like King Kong and be really brave.”
At the World Cup, she will face 1.6-meter jumps — almost as tall as she is at 5-foot-6. And with at least four rounds of competition across four days, the courses will test every aspect of the relationship and communication between horse and rider. What may look like sheer courage to the spectators is really a reflection of Madden’s skill.
“She knows exactly what the capacity of the horse is,” John Madden said. “She’s very scientific about approaching her riding, and she doesn’t even consider herself brave when she goes two seconds faster than anyone in the jumpoff because she’ll say, ‘Yeah, I knew he could do that.’
“Other people might say, ‘she’s really brave,’ and it looks that way,” he said. But on the other hand, when she knows that a tight turn or big jump is outside of the ability of her horse, she doesn’t risk it. “She’s kind of a brave chicken.”
Five riders from the United States will participate in show jumping in Goteborg: Madden, Devin Ryan, Georgina Bloomberg, Eve Jobs and Kelli Cruciotti. And while it’s an individual competition, the riders will go with the full support of the American team.
“They’re riding with their red coats, they’re riding with the U.S. flag, and we treat it as an event for the U.S. team, even though it’s technically an individual competition,” Ridland said. Thirty-five athletes from 18 countries will be riding in show jumping, and the World Cup dressage finals will be held at the same time.
“I love the team competition,” Beezie Madden said, adding that while there isn’t a team award, last year the United States had three riders in the top four. Madden’s past teammates say her competitive edge and vast knowledge help lift the whole team.
“She’s great as a teammate,” said Laura Kraut, also an Olympian, who has competed with Madden for over 30 years. “She’s one of those people who’s as cold as ice. She’s always prepared to go in and provide a clear round when we need one.”
Creating a top show jumping team requires much more than riding ability. Attention to detail and commitment to the process also contribute to Madden’s success, Ridland said. “She didn’t win all she did by being lucky.”
The top riders need to work with owners to buy quality horses and then develop them, and that requires good people skills and a lot of learning and experience, Beezie Madden said.
“You can’t read about it in a book,” she said. “You have to get out there and experience it.”
And as with all types of elite competition, the difference of a winning round is marked with incremental improvements and changes, John Madden said.
“You’re always trying to improve slightly, and that’s a team effort,” he said.
With her victory in 2018 at 54, Beezie Madden became the oldest athlete to win the World Cup. She now finds she has to work a little harder to feel prepared, she said.
“When I was younger, I was like, ‘Oh, I just ride,’ ” she said, but now she works out three times a week with a trainer to maintain strength, balance and her weight.
“The riding keeps you fit for riding,” she said. “But I like to build strength.”
Based in Cazenovia, N.Y., near Syracuse, the Maddens don’t spend much time at their farm. From January through March, they compete in Florida. Then it’s on to Europe for much of the summer, returning to the United States in time for the big shows in the fall. And while the sport carries prestige and a globe-trotting reputation, Beezie Madden maintains a low-key outlook.
“It’s a humbling sport,” she said. “You can win one day and be on the ground the next day.”
Lucy Davis, 26, who rode on the 2016 Olympic show jumping team in Rio de Janeiro with Madden, grew up watching her compete.
“A lot of people get swept up in the glamour of the sport and the competitions and travel, and you can tell she’s in it for the horses,” Davis said. “It’s refreshing to see that the people you grew up idolizing are the real deal.”

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — Albane Valenzuela could have been teeing it up Wednesday in the inaugural Augusta National Women’s Amateur, where the contestants who survive the cut will play the final 18 holes on the fabled course where men will compete at the Masters next week.
Valenzuela, a junior at Stanford and the fifth-ranked women’s amateur in the world, seriously entertained the invitation from the board of governors of the Augusta National Golf Club until she received what she considered a better offer for this week: her third start in the ANA Inspiration, the women’s first major of the year.
“Getting to tee off and play the same course as the world No. 1,” she said Tuesday, referring to South Korea’s Sung Hyun Park, “I think that’s the best experience you can get.”
Augusta National officials have trumpeted their amateur invitational as a grand stage for women’s golf. That overlooks the major originally known as the Dinah Shore, which has captivated young golfers since 1972. The tournament has cultivated indelible traditions like the winner’s leap into Poppie’s Pond and consistently provided significant exposure for top amateurs like Valenzuela, who used her 2016 debut here as a springboard to the Rio Olympics.
Augusta National didn’t admit its first female members until 2012. And while it has since opened its course to boys and girls through the Drive, Chip and Putt contest and to amateur women, these inclusive gestures have ignored — and however unintentionally, undermined — the L.P.G.A., one of the longest-running women’s professional sports organizations.
The Drive, Chip and Putt contest, held the Sunday before the Masters, has siphoned television and other media coverage from the final round of the ANA Inspiration. And with the advent of the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, the spotlight on the best women’s players in the world has become more diffuse.
“I think it comes from a very positive place in Augusta — they want to do the right thing,” Valenzuela said. “It’s probably not my place to say, but it would have been great if both could have worked together to make them happen in different weeks, because you don’t want to get the spotlight off the L.P.G.A.”
The ANA Inspiration matters because the magnetic moments that attracted Valenzuela to the sport as a child didn’t involve Augusta National, which for most of its history has been so far out of the women’s orbit that it might as well have been on Mars.
“Ever since I’ve been a little girl I’ve seen all the girls jump in the pond,” Valenzuela said, adding, “This is the women’s Masters.”
On Wednesday, Jennifer Kupcho, a Wake Forest senior and the top-ranked women’s amateur, struck the opening drive of the new event at the Champions Retreat resort in Evans, Ga., the site of the first two rounds. Only the final round will be played at Augusta National.
Across the country Wednesday, Valenzuela grooved her swing on the Mission Hills practice range. Stacy Lewis, the 2011 ANA Inspiration champion, said she planned to extend a warm welcome to Valenzuela and the four other amateurs in the field: Patty Tavatanakit, Frida Kinhult, Rachel Heck and Xin Kou, who is also known as Cindy.
“I’m really proud of them,” said Lewis, the former women’s world No. 1 who recently returned to competition after the birth in October of her first child, a daughter. “If you want to play professional golf, you need to play in majors, and you need to see where your game stacks up and have that experience of playing in front of those big crowds.”
Valenzuela has advanced to the weekend in each of her previous starts in this event. If she misses the cut this week, she will not be idle over the weekend. Her consolation prize will be joining her Stanford teammates on Sunday at the Silverado Showdown, a collegiate women’s event in Napa.
Stanford is ranked fourth in the Women’s Golf Coaches Association poll and is jockeying with other top teams for seeding positions at next month’s N.C.A.A. championship. Another Stanford star, Andrea Lee, chose to play in Georgia this week.
Anne Walker, Valenzuela’s coach at Stanford, said in a telephone interview that she welcomed Augusta National’s move into the women’s game, describing it as “another great opportunity that’s opened up.”
But in its exuberance to grow the game, Augusta National big-footed more than the L.P.G.A. schedule. “There’s very little discussion about the timing of it as it relates to college golf,” Walker said.
She pointed out that Texas, which is ranked second behind the University of Southern California, competed in the Bruzzy Challenge this week in Texas without three of its top players: Emilee Hoffman, Agathe Laisne and Kaitlyn Papp, who are in Augusta. The Longhorns finished tied for seventh, their lowest finish of the season by three places.
Walker ultimately described the scheduling conflicts as “a great problem to have.”
But they are a problem, nonetheless.
When the Augusta National chairman, Fred Ridley, announced the new event last year, he said: “We think that to have one week where the future greats of the game and the current greats of the women’s game are all competing on a big stage is, it’s just very exciting.”
Referring to L.P.G.A. Commissioner Mike Whan, who was not consulted before the Augusta tournament was scheduled, Ridley added, “I think he also understands that in time it’s going to be a win for the L.P.G.A.”
Lewis said she would love to see the Augusta event played at a different time of year.
Referring to the amateurs, she added, “Maybe they could get a full tournament on Augusta National. Get a couple practice rounds and a three-round tournament there.”
Or better yet, the Augusta National members could find a way to welcome the 8-year-old girls and the 18-year-old amateurs after they have grown into the best women players on the planet.
It’s a win-win for golf any time the best women mix with the best men, as Brittany Lincicome, a two-time ANA Inspiration champion, recently was reminded.
Lincicome spent two days last month at the PGA Tour’s flagship event in Florida, and she was shocked when players like Sergio Garcia and Rory McIlroy saw her behind the rope lines and came bounding over to ask if she would pose for selfies with them.
Lincicome, 33, has been slow to recognize that her start last year in a PGA Tour event in Kentucky trumped either of her victorious finishes here.
“I had no idea they knew who I was,” she said.
If the L.P.G.A. has to move the date of its first major to accommodate Augusta National, here’s one idea how Augusta National members could make the change palatable. They could extend an invitation to the women’s reigning major winners to compete alongside the men in the Masters’ par-3 contest. That would be more meaningful start than a flashy 18-hole finish to an amateur event.

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion.
April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season.
“That’s amazing, isn’t it?” Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final.
But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke.
Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.
She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia’s 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup.
Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women’s season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami.
There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men’s doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas.
The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday’s victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo.
“If you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,” Bob Bryan said.
Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova.
Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak.
But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women’s tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.
Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980.
Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors “we” and “team” more than “I” when discussing her rise.)
Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.
Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday’s final.
But it is Barty’s tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed.
Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova’s six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova’s 66 percent.
Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace.
Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women’s tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm.
“I have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,” Barty said. “It’s always about trying to neutralize what your opponent’s doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women’s tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women’s side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points.”
She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova’s flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).
It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential.
“I think I was an average cricketer, and I’m becoming a better tennis player,” she said. “It was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling.”
So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige.
Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well.

The high-profile partnership was announced on Thursday.
By Jonah Engel Bromwich and Vanessa Friedman
After Kanye and Adidas, and Rihanna and Puma; after Questlove and Nike, and Kendrick Lamar and Reebok, it was only a matter of time. And on Thursday, the first lady of Everything, Beyoncé Knowles, entered the sneaker wars.
Adidas announced that it would collaborate with Ms. Knowles on several endeavors, including a signature collection with Adidas and an expansion of the singer’s active-wear brand, Ivy Park. She will be a creative partner at Adidas.
In a statement, Ms. Knowles called the coming collaboration the “partnership of a lifetime” and touted a shared philosophy “that puts creativity, growth and social responsibility at the forefront of business.”
The pop star and entrepreneur will retain ownership of Ivy Park, which was introduced in 2016 in partnership with Topshop and sells comfort wear and athleisure at retailers including Nordstrom. In 2018, Ms. Knowles acquired full ownership of the company after Sir Philip Green, Topshop’s owner, was accused of racial abuse and sexual harassment.
Little financial information about Ivy Park is available, and it is unclear how successful the brand has been. It was immediately popular upon its release in 2016. On Thursday, its website had been altered to broadcast the Adidas partnership.
The Beyoncé/Adidas collaboration is perhaps the most notable partnership between a superstar and a sports brand yet, and it indicates the consumer and social power that can be derived from such cross-branding. It is also a tribute to the lane Rihanna paved in 2014 when she became a creative director and global ambassador at Puma, back when it was still a novel idea that an entertainer might lend her name to a company best known for athletic apparel. (Rihanna parted ways with Puma and is now said to be working with LVMH on her own luxury brand.)
Championing women and girls has become a key part of Adidas’s public relations strategy. This month, the company announced a new phase of its “She Breaks Barriers” initiative, which highlights the lack of equal media coverage for women’s sports in the United States. 
Ms. Knowles has positioned herself as a political voice for black Americans and for women, including through her musical examination of her marriage and her 2018 Coachella performance, which gave a platform to historically black colleges. She will amplify these messages, and those Adidas has already pushed, by giving the company her imprimatur.
“Beyoncé is an iconic creator but also a proven business leader, and together, we have the ability to inspire change and empower the next generation of creators,” said Eric Liedtke, a member of the executive board of Adidas AG.
Adidas’s “multilayered” partnership with Ms. Knowles will include a program whose resources will be given over to “the next generation of athletes, creators and leaders.”
Last July, Forbes estimated that Ms. Knowles was worth $355 million, citing her most recent solo album, “Lemonade,” her million-dollar-grossing tour with her husband Jay-Z and the value of her stake in his streaming service, Tidal.

There is no shortage of Lionel Messi content on the World Wide Web. The 31-year-old soccer superstar ranks high in surveys of top Google searches, one of just a few human beings to earn a spot among such keyword perennials as “Facebook,” “weather” and “free porn.” In a 2015 tally of the most Googled person in each nation on earth, Messi tied Kim Kardashian for the most No. 1s, with a global reach that extended from his native Argentina to Haiti, Turkmenistan, Senegal and 22 other countries.
Messi is also one of the world’s pre-eminent viral video stars. Countless clips document “Messi magic,” a playing style of almost unseemly brilliance. On social media, users share videos of Messi’s slipping passes through improbably tight spaces, corkscrewing shots past sprawling goalkeepers, darting around defenders like a jack rabbit navigating a gantlet of sloths. Type “Messi” into a YouTube search field, and you will find hundreds of highlight compilations with bombastic titles: “Lionel Messi sees things we don’t even consider,” “Lionel Messi: — A God Amongst Men,” “Lionel Messi: Extraterrestrial.”
So it was not exactly surprising when, on March 17, the internet was captivated by a Messi goal. It came in the 85th minute of a 4-1 victory for Messi’s club team, FC Barcelona, over the Seville-based Real Betis. Messi gathered the ball about 24 yards from the Betis goal, slid a pass to his teammate Ivan Rakitić and then flowed forward to receive a return pass. The goal that followed was so easeful, so understated, that it was momentarily hard to process. Messi struck the ball in full stride but with shocking delicacy, lifting a chip shot that arced gracefully across the penalty area. The ball drifted beyond the reach of the goalie, Pau López, scraped the underside of the crossbar and dropped into the goal. Messi had taken his shot from a diagonal position more than 20 yards away, but it was not the stinging kick generally required to score from that spot. The ball’s trajectory was languid and dreamy, like a gull gliding on an ocean breeze.
Messi had already scored twice in the game. But the beauty and impudence of this goal — by some counts, the 656th of Messi’s professional career — was clear to all. Betis supporters stood to applaud their tormentor. Soccer pundits reached for celestial metaphors. On ESPN.com, the journalist Musa Okwonga wrote that “the ball, with the glorious inevitability of our slowly dying sun, rose and fell.” The wildest exultations came from the operatic English TV commentator Ray Hudson, who unleashed a torrent of mixed metaphors. “The staggering genius of Lionel Messi!” he cried, during a live broadcast on the beIN SPORTS network. “This miraculous footballer, this halo of a footballer! ... He’s got an algebraic equation to solve in the blink of a baby’s eye, and he does it in a way that is just so poetic!”
Hudson is onto something with this talk of algebra and poetry. Messi’s greatness lies in his mind as much as his body. Watching replays of the goal, you marvel above all at the audacity of Messi’s idea. A chip? From that distance, at that angle, in that frenzied moment of open-field play? It’s nuts — a fool’s fantasy that blossoms, with every slow-motion replay, into wondrous fact. Messi saw something we didn’t even consider.
That viral clip is a testament to Messi’s supernatural talent. It’s also a reminder that online video is changing the way we consume and conceptualize sports. Decades ago, the culture of “highlights” was already transforming America’s pastimes. The decline of slow-paced baseball, the ascendancy of the razzle-dazzle N.B.A., the rule changes that have brought an offensive explosion in the N.F.L. — these developments were fueled in no small part by the rise of ESPN’s SportsCenter and the primacy of video clips. But in the old days, those highlight packages were appointment viewing, available only on nightly broadcasts. Today highlights spread across the web in seconds, mutating into memes and turning star athletes into visual brands. You don’t have to be a purist to wonder how this media ecosystem is affecting our tolerance for the natural rhythms and longueurs of sports, those lengthy stretches of “lowlight” play that are only occasionally punctuated by thrills.
Soccer is a subtle game; in general, goals are hard to come by. It would seem to be the major sport most antithetical to highlight culture. (For all those moments of Messi magic, the essence of his greatness may lie in untelegenic maneuverings off the ball, the cagey movements that put him into positions where he can erupt.) But viral video is altering our view of soccer’s history. Today’s fans compare clips while endlessly debating the “greatest of all time” status of Messi and his chief rival, the Portuguese striker Cristiano Ronaldo. The GOATs of previous eras — like Pelé, Johan Cruyff and Diego Maradona — recede into the background: They had the misfortune to play in a time before a footballer’s every exploit was captured on video. If a player’s “receipts” aren’t on YouTube, he’s liable to lose to his toehold in the historiography.
Yet for the 21st-century soccer fan, online video is a godsend — the only conceivable way to keep up with the ultimate global sport. With a mobile phone and a well-curated social media feed, it is now possible to follow great matches on five different continents, nearly every day, in real time.
As for Messi: I know few more pleasurable ways to kill a couple of hours than by squinting at a liquid-crystal screen, bugging out to the likes of “Lionel Messi Humiliating Players Two or More Times in the Same Play.” Messi is the quintessential internet-age soccer star — he scored his first goal for Barcelona in 2005, the year YouTube went online — but his persona is a throwback to an earlier period. He is a trickster and a funnyman, like an old-time silent-movie star. He’s small and scrappy, standing just 5-foot-7, the Charlie Chaplin to suave Ronaldo’s Rudolph Valentino. Many of his greatest moments play out like slapstick farce, leaving pratfalling defenders littered across the pitch.
At their best, sports like soccer are the digital age’s most reliable suppliers of an old-fashioned brand of entertainment, the special-effects-free kind, in which human beings use only their sinews and synapses to deliver thrills and spills, action and comedy. Messi’s chip in the Betis match was a comedic set piece in its own right. On YouTube, you can find video montages of the play’s aftermath: Messi and his teammates celebrating and cracking up, the goalie López mugging like an exasperated vaudeville straight man, play-by-play announcers dissolving in peals of laughter. The goal is a cosmic joke if there ever was one. A small man swings his left leg; a ball loops skyward; common sense and natural laws are suspended. You know the punch line: The ball will fall back to earth, landing — plop — in the back of the net. But no matter how many times you watch it, the gag still kills.

In many ways, there has never been a better time to be a member of the United States women’s national hockey team.
Two years after the players threatened to boycott the world championship tournament over pay equity, U.S.A. Hockey, the national governing body, is paying them more than ever, about $71,000 each annually.
On the ice, the American women have continued to exceed the achievements of the men’s national team and won their second Olympic gold medal in a stirring final against Canada.
Members of the team have skated in the skills competition at N.H.L. All-Star weekend and served as analysts for N.H.L. television broadcasts. Participation in the sport among girls and women is skyrocketing.
But halfway through the labor contract with U.S.A. Hockey signed in March 2017, as the national team begins its pursuit of a fifth straight world championship in Finland this week, its players wonder whether the future of their sport is as bright as the present. Those concerns grew after the Canadian Women’s Hockey League, one of two professional leagues in North America, announced Sunday it would fold in May.
Although the American players negotiated gains in salary and travel and medical benefits two years ago, the “groundbreaking support” for girls and women’s hockey promised by U.S.A. Hockey in the contract has been slow to develop. The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group created in the deal has been largely invisible. Minimal promotion for the team and a lack of organizational diversity in U.S.A. Hockey also raise concerns from players and female alumni that little has changed.
“People are drooling for women’s hockey,” forward Kendall Coyne Schofield said in an interview late last year. “But the product we deliver isn’t being shown. There’s been a lot of lost opportunities, a lot of opportunities that haven’t been capitalized on.”
Those opportunities included high-profile media appearances before the Olympics like a national magazine feature, a major network documentary series and other live television offers, which U.S.A. Hockey declined, according to three people with direct knowledge of those projects. After the Olympics, some players were unaware that they were eligible for four-figure bonuses offered by Hershey’s for winning the gold medal.
U.S.A. Hockey’s executive director, Pat Kelleher, was not made available for an interview to discuss the women’s national team.
After the Olympics, the women’s team embarked on a weeklong national media tour, but players were frustrated that there were no plans for a post-Olympic exhibition tour. In an interview late last year, forward Hilary Knight lamented that the team disappeared when its popularity was at its highest.
Because of the talent disparity between North American teams and the rest of the world, there are not many viable opponents for the Americans, and Canada’s cooperation is necessary. Last month, the two nations finally staged a three-game exhibition series, with one game in the United States. An announced crowd of 9,048 fans attended the game in Detroit, which was also broadcast live on NHL Network.
But other avenues to increase exposure do not need Canadian co-signs, like merchandising. Nike, the official apparel supplier of U.S.A. Hockey and a company that champions equality in advertisements, does not sell jerseys of American women’s players or products specifically featuring female players. Neither does U.S.A. Hockey’s online store.
Coyne Schofield, one of the players who has been featured by the N.H.L. since the Olympics, is inundated with inquiries from parents about where they can buy apparel with her name. She has memorized a response with detailed instructions on how to purchase customized men’s items, even down to the six-week shipping time frame. That’s how Knight obtained replicas of her jersey for her family.
“That alone is so degrading,” Coyne Schofield said. “There’s no reason why anybody shouldn’t be able to go on usahockey.com and buy a Hilary Knight jersey, my jersey. Right now, women’s hockey is not accessible to consumers. It needs to be accessible in every fashion.”
Nike, which recently unveiled soccer kits for the 2019 Women’s World Cup that for the first time were specifically designed for women’s teams, did not respond to requests to discuss its women’s hockey apparel.
As with the jerseys, the American players handle much of their promotion themselves. Despite repeated requests from athletes, U.S.A. Hockey has not created social medial channels dedicated solely to the women’s team, as U.S. Soccer has. Olympians like Coyne Schofield and Monique Lamoureux-Morando worked as analysts on NHL Network and NBCSN. The players have lobbied the N.H.L. for more support for women’s hockey, particularly for its professionals, whose salaries range from $2,000 to $10,000.
The Women’s High Performance Advisory Group was supposed to be a conduit of influence for the players. Over the past two years, U.S.A. Hockey declined repeated requests to discuss the group.
The New York Times confirmed the participation of at least five women in the group, including hockey executives and members of the 2018 Olympic team. Multiple people with knowledge of meetings said the group was stagnant in its first year and only recently began having meaningful conversations. One player said she was unsure if she was allowed to talk about the group.
In March, the N.H.L. and the N.H.L. Players’ Association announced the formation of their own Female Hockey Advisory Committee with the goal “to accelerate the growth” of hockey for girls and women in North America, and named 11 members, all women. They include Michele Amidon, a former director for women’s hockey at U.S.A. Hockey, and several former members of the U.S. national women’s team.
But women’s representation remains lacking in U.S.A. Hockey’s leadership.
Of all American Winter Olympic governing sports bodies, U.S.A. Hockey has the lowest percentage of women on its board of directors (17.58 percent) and is the worst at reaching its benchmark for female hires, according to the most recent data available from the United States Olympic Committee.
There are full-fledged councils within U.S.A. Hockey devoted to youth, adult and junior hockey, but none specifically for girls and women. Decisions related to girls’ and women’s hockey are administered by the youth council, which is led by a man and where only four of the 25 members are women. There are also no women on the organization’s marketing council.
Proponents for U.S. women’s hockey have long struggled to have their voices heard. Lynn Olson became the first woman hired to work for U.S.A. Hockey’s girls and women’s section back in 1988, but it served only as an advisory panel to the board of directors.
During her tenure, which ended in 2013, Olson described U.S.A. Hockey as being run like a “good old boys club.” She was sometimes denied funds to hold meetings for her panel, so she put up her own money. Olson also said she tried to make the section a full-fledged council, which would provide more influence, writing up legislation that never passed.
Olson noted that more women wanted to be involved in U.S.A. Hockey, but had a hard time getting elected to positions of power. “You need to change the minds of males in the room,” she said.
Veteran leaders of the hockey team expressed faith that the culture could change under Kelleher, who was named U.S.A. Hockey’s executive director in April 2017. In recent months, he met with players in Maine, Chicago and Michigan.
“We hadn’t had that in the past,” Coyne Schofield said. “For me, it was a huge first impression.”
The United States national women’s soccer team, an inspiration for the hockey team in its fight for equality, was so frustrated with the lack of progress on a number of issues that the players recently filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against its governing body, U.S. Soccer.
Knight said she did not yet foresee a repeat of the fraught 2017 negotiations that led to the boycott threat and a fracture between U.S.A. Hockey and the women’s team that is still being repaired.
U.S.A. Hockey seems to be aware of the need for more gender balance. Don Gould, chairman of the girls and women’s section, said at the federation’s annual meeting that the organizational culture must evolve to advance opportunities for girls and women, socially and in sport.
“This objective cannot be realized without first creating an environment that values them equally at every level,” Gould said. “Whether we work on the bench or in the boardroom, this is our first obligation.”
But nine of 10 members of U.S.A. Hockey’s committee that nominates candidates to become officers of the organization are men.
“There are great people at the top that care about women’s hockey, but you absolutely don’t have the numbers to have a real change,” said Angela Ruggiero, one of the most accomplished American hockey players and a former member of the International Olympic Committee Athletes’ Commission. “We have an extremely long way to go.”

SURPRISE, Ariz. — After the Kansas City Royals departed for a spring training road game last month, their general manager, Dayton Moore, stayed behind at the team’s training complex to watch prospects on the back fields. It was from there, more than a decade ago, that a longtime coach, Bill Fischer, had called him excitedly to share a vision.
“Fish said, ‘I just saw the Latin version of Johnny Bench,’” Moore said, sitting in a dugout and smiling at the memory. “I said, ‘Who’s that?’ He said, ‘Salvador Perez.’ Fish recognized it right away.”
Bench may have been the greatest catcher ever, but Perez is the only other catcher to make at least six All-Star teams while winning five Gold Gloves and a World Series Most Valuable Player Award.
He is a rare modern species: a high-impact offensive catcher who plays a lot of games.
As recently as 2007, 28 players appeared in at least 95 games as a catcher. Last season that number had dwindled to 15, the fewest since the majors expanded to 30 teams in 1998. Perez did it for the sixth season in a row, but his streak will end in 2019: At the moment Moore spoke, Perez was in Los Angeles to undergo Tommy John surgery, which will cost him the season.
“It’s a big blow to the morale of the organization, because Salvy’s our energy-giver out there,” Moore said. “The fans adore him, and they show up to watch him play regardless of where we are in the standings.”
Without Perez — who hit 27 homers in each of the last two seasons — catchers’ offensive production could slip again this season. In 2018, major league catchers produced a .233 batting average and a .678 on-base plus slugging percentage, both the lowest figures of the 30-team era.
“It’s a very physically demanding position, but that’s been true for years,” said Matt Klentak, the general manager of the Philadelphia Phillies. “On top of that, there has been a shift throughout the league in recent years in the way catcher defense is evaluated, prioritizing catcher framing. The impact of framing on a game is real, and in some cases teams are willing to trade out some offense in exchange for better receiving skills.”
Catchers who can hit are still valued, as evidenced by the Phillies’ trade with the Miami Marlins for J. T. Realmuto, the game’s best offensive catcher. But the Boston Red Sox showed last season that a slugger behind the plate is not always necessary: They won the World Series despite a .194 average and .533 O.P.S. from their catchers, the worst marks for any champion in the live-ball era.
“We look at catcher as a defensive position,” said Dave Dombrowski, Boston’s president of baseball operations. “And so the defensive efficiencies they bring to us, not only the things you can measure with framing, throwing guys out and time to second base, but handling the staff, following the game plan that we want — we put a high priority on that.”
And the job is only getting more challenging. Teams use more pitchers per season than ever, and while fastball velocity has risen in recent years, pitchers are also throwing a greater percentage of breaking balls. That is one factor explaining why wild pitches and passed balls are on the rise.
More important, though, is the emphasis on framing — that is, getting borderline pitches called for strikes. When a catcher tries to present a pitch on the corner as a strike, he will try to keep most of his glove in the strike zone. Catching such pitches in the tip of the webbing, and not the pocket, naturally leads to more pitches that clip the edge of the mitt and roll away.
“It may be the most demanding position in all of sports,” Moore said. “There are more good N.F.L. quarterbacks than there are complete major league catchers with the standards we were raised with.”
Those standards are changing, as reflected by the Red Sox, who were so satisfied with catchers Blake Swihart and Christian Vasquez that they brought them both back despite their weak bats. Boston catchers excelled on defense, ranking third in the majors at framing, according to Baseball Prospectus. The two teams above them were the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers and, in first place, the Arizona Diamondbacks.
It is no coincidence that one of Arizona’s catchers last season, Jeff Mathis, attracted the attention of the team that ranked worst at framing, the Texas Rangers. Mathis hit .200 and has a .198 average across 14 seasons, but his exceptional defensive skills earned him a two-year, $6.25 million deal from the Rangers.
That is a modest deal by industry standards, but it is the richest one Mathis, who turns 36 this month, has ever signed. He might have had little market appeal anymore if not for today’s methods of measuring defense.
“I’ve always taken a lot of pride in the defensive side of my game,” Mathis said. “Obviously I’d love to contribute a lot more offensively, and I think I can. But for them to acknowledge defense the way they have the last few years is something that I’ve definitely benefited from and definitely thankful for.”
Jon Daniels, the Rangers’ president of baseball operations, said the team determined at the start of the off-season to target a defensive-oriented catcher. The Rangers are entering their final season at outdoor Globe Life Park — a hitter’s paradise — and plan to integrate young pitchers onto their roster as they move to an indoor ballpark in 2020.
Besides Mathis, the Rangers considered Martin Maldonado, who lingered on the market and eventually signed with the Royals as Perez’s replacement, for $2.5 million. Maldonado had a meager .616 O.P.S. for the Los Angeles Angels last season but still appealed to the Houston Astros, who traded for him in July and started him in six of their eight playoff games.
The previous October, Brian McCann caught every inning for the Astros through their victory in Game 7 of the World Series. The 35-year-old McCann, who is second on the active list in games caught behind the St. Louis Cardinals’ Yadier Molina, slumped to a .212 average last season and signed for one year and $2 million with his original team, the Atlanta Braves.
Jeff Luhnow, the Astros’ general manager and a former Cardinals executive, spoke wistfully recently about “the days of having a Yadi Molina.” He could not bring himself to say that those days are over, but he does not see a successor.
“I’m sure there will be some guys like that in the future, but I don’t know why we’re not developing catchers as much,” Luhnow said. “Of all the positions in baseball, that’s probably the thinnest.”
This may simply be a down cycle; Baseball America ranked seven catchers among its top 100 prospects this season, the most since 2012. Then again, that crop from seven years ago — Travis d’Arnaud, Yasmani Grandal, Devin Mesoraco, Jesus Montero, Wilin Rosario, Gary Sanchez and Swihart — has not yielded many stars.
Neal Huntington, the Pittsburgh Pirates’ general manager, said the rise of year-round amateur baseball could be burning out catching prospects; the relentless physical demands, he said, do not help developing hitters. If a catching prospect shows a promising bat, he added, talent evaluators may want him to change positions. (Bryce Harper, the Phillies’ new $330 million outfielder, was a catcher as an amateur.)
“The guy who may be a midrange defender but can swing the bat a little bit, we may be thinking about shifting him out from behind home plate because we want the bat to play — and we’ve become so strict on receiving analytics that we’re almost unforgiving in some cases,” Huntington said.
“So we’ve shifted the pendulum way to the defensive side because we recognize the value it brings. There’s also value in that guy who can receive and hit, but that guy who’s an exceptional receiver, he gets the benefit of the doubt every single time, and we’ve been able to quantify that. So the guys that used to kind of fade away are now hanging around longer.”
Mathis was not the only veteran catcher to receive a multiyear deal in free agency. Kurt Suzuki, 35, got a two-year, $10 million contract in November from the Washington Nationals, who did not stop there. Ten days later, they traded for Yan Gomes, an All-Star catcher for Cleveland last season.
Suzuki — who caught 141 games for Oakland in 2008, his first full season in the majors — said he was happy to share the role. The same analytics wave that identifies and values catchers’ defense also makes the job more demanding because of the volume of information to process before games.
“It used to be a DVD,” Suzuki said. “You’d watch video and go, ‘This is how we’re going to get him out.’ Now you’ve got all these heat maps, velocities, and you’re like, ‘Wow, this is a brain cram.’ It’s a lot of studying, a lot of stress and strain on the brain. To have that mental rest is awesome.”
The Nationals’ time-sharing plan is becoming more of the rule than the exception. The productive hitter who catches nearly every game is harder and harder to find — even, at least for this season, in Kansas City.

RIYADH — Saudi Arabia's King Salman will provide Iraq $1 billion to build a sports city, state television said on Wednesday, the start of two-day visit to Iraq by high-level Saudi officials aimed at boosting ties.
Riyadh has been wooing Baghdad as part of an effort to stem the growing regional influence of Iran, while Iraq is seeking economic benefits from closer ties with its southern neighbour.
A Saudi economic delegation that includes the energy and investment ministers arrived in Iraq on Wednesday for the second Saudi-Iraq coordination council meeting, an initiative launched in 2017 to upgrade diplomatic relations.
Saudi Arabia reopened its embassy in Baghdad in 2015 following a 25-year break.
Saudi investment minister Majid bin Abdullah al-Qasabi said it would open its consulate in Baghdad on Thursday to begin issuing visas for Iraqis and that three other consulates would be opened in Iraq, according to Iraq's state news agency.
Qasabi said that 13 agreements were ready to be signed and that work on the Arar land border crossing linking Iraq and Saudi Arabia would be completed within six months.

PRESTON, England — A British jury failed to reach a decision Wednesday on whether the man in control of police operations at the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium tragedy that left 96 people dead is guilty of gross negligence manslaughter.
Jurors at Preston Crown Court in northern England deliberated for eight days in the case of David Duckenfield, 74, who has denied 95 counts. The victims, all Liverpool fans, died in a crush in the stadium during a soccer match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.
There can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries.
A former official of Sheffield Wednesday soccer club, Graham Mackrell, 69, was found guilty of failing to discharge his duties under the Health and Safety at Work Act. The club's home ground was Hillsborough.
Mackrell is to be sentenced on May 13. He faces a maximum sentence of an unlimited fine.
Prosecutors said they will seek a retrial for Duckenfield.
"I recognize that these developments will be difficult for the families affected by the Hillsborough disaster," said Sue Hemming, director of legal services for the Crown Prosecution Service.
The original verdicts of accidental death for the victims were overturned in 2012 after documents uncovered mistakes by authorities and a cover-up by police, following a long campaign by families of the victims of Britain's worst sports disaster.
Liverpool reacted to the decision reached by the jurors by saying the soccer club "can empathize with the frustration shared by everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy that the outcome was not definitive."

CARACAS — Classes resumed in Venezuela's schools on Wednesday after two major national blackouts left frustrated parents struggling to entertain their children and forced the education ministry to extend the school year.
Two major nationwide power outages led the government to cancel classes across the country. President Nicolas Maduro said earlier this week that classes would resume on Wednesday. 
Education Minister Aristobulo Isturiz said classes, which usually end at the beginning of July, would continue until the end of that month, state-run news agency AVN reported.
"This Wednesday, children resume [classes], with much love and enthusiasm," Youth Minister Pedro Infante wrote on Twitter.
Classes at primary schools, high schools and universities were suspended for a week each at the beginning and end of March in the face of prolonged power outages.
As a result of the blackouts, the water pumping and telecommunications systems were also paralyzed. The resumption of services has been uneven for the member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with cities such as San Cristóbal, Valencia and Maracay still reporting intermittent supply of electricity.
In Maracay, about 120 kilometers southwest of Caracas, parents said some schools had few teachers.
"At my son's school, there were only four teachers and they just let the boys play sports," said Griselda Ascabio, a 39-year-old secretary.
With at least 6.4 million students enrolled in public schools and 1.2 million in private institutes, the Ministry of Education has not reported how many effectively returned to their activities on Wednesday. The Ministry of Information did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Regular exercise changes the look and workings of the human heart. And researchers are discovering that different sports affect the heart differently. 
By Gretchen Reynolds
Do world-class swimmers’ hearts function differently than the hearts of elite runners?
A new study finds that the answer may be yes, and the differences, although slight, could be telling and consequential, even for those of us who swim or run at a much less lofty level. 
Cardiologists and exercise scientists already know that regular exercise changes the look and workings of the human heart. The left ventricle, in particular, alters with exercise. This chamber of the heart receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumps it out to the rest of the body, using a rather strenuous twisting and unspooling motion, as if the ventricle were a sponge being wrung out before springing back into shape.
Exercise, especially aerobic exercise, requires that considerable oxygen be delivered to working muscles, placing high demands on the left ventricle. In response, this part of the heart in athletes typically becomes larger and stronger than in sedentary people and functions more efficiently, filling with blood a little earlier and more fully and untwisting with each heartbeat a bit more rapidly, allowing the heart to pump more blood more quickly.
While almost any exercise can prompt remodeling of the left ventricle over time, different types of exercise often produce subtly different effects. A 2015 study found, for instance, that competitive rowers, whose sport combines endurance and power, had greater muscle mass in their left ventricles than runners, making their hearts strong but potentially less nimble during the twisting that pumps blood to muscles. 
These past studies compared the cardiac effects of land-based activities, though, with an emphasis on running. Few have examined swimming, even though it is not only a popular exercise but unique. Swimmers, unlike runners, lie prone, in buoyant water and hold their breaths, all of which could affect cardiac demands and how the heart responds and remakes itself.
So, for the new study, which was published in November in Frontiers in Physiology, researchers at the University of Guelph in Canada and other institutions set out to map the structure and function of elite swimmers’ and runners’ hearts.
The researchers focused on world-class performers because those athletes would have been running or swimming strenuously for years, presumably exaggerating any differential effects of their training, the researchers reasoned.
Eventually they recruited 16 national-team runners and another 16 comparable swimmers, male and female, some of them sprinters and others distance specialists.
They asked the athletes to visit the exercise lab after not exercising for 12 hours and then, when on site, to lie quietly. They checked heart rates and blood pressures and finally examined the athletes’ hearts with echocardiograms, which show both the structure and functioning of the organ.
It turned out, to no one’s surprise, that the athletes, whether runners or swimmers, enjoyed enviable heart health. Their heart rates hovered around 50 beats per minute, with the runners’ rates slightly lower than the swimmers’. But all of the athletes’ heart rates were much lower than is typical for sedentary people, signifying that their hearts were robust.
The athletes also had relatively large, efficient left ventricles, their echocardiograms showed.
But there were interesting if small differences between the swimmers and runners, the researchers found. While all of the athletes’ left ventricles filled with blood earlier than average and untwisted more quickly during each heartbeat, those desirable changes were amplified in the runners. Their ventricles filled even earlier and untwisted more emphatically than the swimmers’ hearts did.
In theory, those differences should allow blood to move from and back to the runners’ hearts more rapidly than would happen inside the swimmers’.
But these differences do not necessarily show that the runners’ hearts worked better than the swimmers’, says Jamie Burr, a professor at the University of Guelph and director of its human performance lab, who conducted the new study with the lead author, Katharine Currie, and others.
Since swimmers exercise in a horizontal position, he says, their hearts do not have to fight gravity to get blood back to the heart, unlike in upright runners. Posture does some of the work for swimmers, and so their hearts reshape themselves only as much as needed for the demands of their sport.
The findings underscore how exquisitely sensitive our bodies are to different types of exercise, Dr. Burr says.
They also might provide a reason for swimmers sometimes to consider logging miles on the road, he says, to intensify the remodeling of their hearts.
Of course, the athletes here were tested while resting, not competing, he says, and it is not clear whether any variations in their ventricles would be meaningful during races.
The study also was cross-sectional, meaning it looked at the athletes only once. They might have been born with unusual cardiac structures that somehow allowed them to excel at their sports, instead of the sports changing their hearts.
Dr. Burr, however, doubts that. Exercise almost certainly remakes our hearts, he says, and he hopes future experiments can tell us more about how each activity affects us and which might be best for different people.
But even now, he says, “an important message is that all of the athletes showed better function than a normal person off the street, which supports the message that exercise is good for hearts.”

Executives have been burned by their previous dealings with big tech companies. But Apple’s promise of a billion devices worldwide was too good to pass up. Even for Rupert Murdoch.
By Edmund Lee
Like many other media executives, Pamela Wasserstein was wary of tech giants and their attempts to go into business with content creators.
“There was great optimism around partnerships, and I think that optimism has largely cooled, and people are now more cautious,” said Ms. Wasserstein, the chief executive of New York Media, the publisher of New York magazine and web titles like The Cut and Vulture.
But like others in her position at publishers like Condé Nast, Dow Jones and Meredith, she put caution aside and joined Apple’s media initiative, the recently unveiled Apple News Plus app, which promises to blast out content across more than a billion devices worldwide.
The tech giant based the service on an app it acquired last year called Texture, which gave readers access to some 200 publications with a single subscription. The revamped and renamed version, introduced with much fanfare last week at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., charges subscribers $9.99 a month ($12.99 in Canada) for content from more than 300 titles, including The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, Vogue, Time, The Atlantic and People, as well as The Los Angeles Times and The Wall Street Journal. (Also included: Airbnb Magazine, Birds & Blooms, Retro Gamer and Salt Water Sportsman, befitting the app’s conceit as an omnibus newsstand.)
Weighing the pros and cons, Ms. Wasserstein concluded that Apple News Plus would allow her publications to reach “a new audience in an environment that feels right for us.”
Going into business with a tech giant was a calculated risk. Like most publishers, New York Media had seen its revenue shrink in an internet environment where Google and Facebook scoop up advertising dollars and have great influence over what people read. (New York Media’s online sales have grown more recently.) 
There’s a sense among Manhattan’s media ranks that any deal with Silicon Valley amounts to a fool’s bargain.
Now, by necessity, magazines, newspapers and websites have learned to be promiscuous tradesmen to stop relying on one revenue source. They have embraced new business lines like branded content, conferences and podcasts just to diversify and stay afloat.
Ms. Wasserstein was among the publishers at the Steve Jobs Theater when Apple unveiled the service. On stage, Tim Cook, the chief executive, contrasted Apple’s editorial approach to the “very different choice” other companies have made. It was a notable remark, given the criticism of Facebook and Google over their role in spreading misinformation.
Apple’s plan was something altogether different, Mr. Cook promised. “This is going to take Apple News to a whole new level,” he said. Cheers bounced around the room — half occupied by Apple employees — as glossy magazine covers skated across the giant screen at his back.
The marketing event seems to have accomplished its goal. More than 200,000 people subscribed to Apple News Plus in its first 48 hours — more than Texture had amassed at its peak, according to two people with knowledge of the figures who asked not to be named to discuss confidential information. (Texture’s subscribers have not been counted toward Apple’s subscribers.)
The New York Times and The Washington Post did not join the effort, despite intense lobbying from Apple. Mark Thompson, the chief executive of The Times, said the problem with the app, from his perspective, was how it “jumbled different news sources into these superficially attractive mixtures,” making it difficult for users to know which publication they’re consuming. A spokeswoman for The Post said that the paper’s “focus is on growing our own subscription base” and that it was not interested in offering its wares through another company.
Some executives who said yes to the plan seemed less than sanguine, but they declined to comment publicly for fear of upsetting Apple or violating the ironclad nondisclosure agreements the news companies had signed.
In addition to allowing their publications to be part of Apple’s big bundle, publishers have risked cannibalizing their own subscription efforts by signing on. At $9.99 a month, Apple News Plus is a bargain, especially for casual readers. The Journal, by contrast, charges a monthly fee of $39 for digital access. Online subscriptions to The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Wired — all owned by Condé Nast — together cost more than $10 a month. The New Yorker by itself costs $7.50.
The day after the splashy announcement, The New Yorker found itself on the defensive after a Reuters headline blared: “Is it time to dump your New Yorker subscription?” In reply, Michael Luo, the editor of The New Yorker’s website, sounded off in a 13-part tweetstorm advising readers not to dump the magazine. Only a portion of its archive would be available on the Apple service, he wrote, and readers could miss out on certain articles by Ronan Farrow, Jane Mayer and Doreen St. Félix, not to mention the weekly crossword.
“The best way to read ALL that we do @newyorker every day and every week is to subscribe,” Mr. Luo tweeted.
Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner and publisher of The Los Angeles Times, seemed unworried about tying the paper’s fortunes to Apple, saying in an email that the service would “encourage more people to pay for quality content.”
The Journal reported that, thanks to the deal with Apple, it would add 50 people to its newsroom. But the union that represents the paper’s employees noted the new job listings were open to contract workers.
“It would be the first time that we’d see a move toward an unprotected work force,” Tim Martell, the union’s executive director, said. “We don’t like the uncertainty.”
To abide by the union’s contract with The Journal, Mr. Martell added, contract workers in the newsroom would be allowed to work for a maximum of 12 months. That suggests the Journal sees these hires as a temporary assignment — a compromise approach — as it gauges the benefits and costs of the Apple partnership.
The majority of Journal stories will appear on the service, but with only a three-day archive. Content for niche groups, such as CFO Journal, which is aimed at the financial community, and CMO Today, geared toward advertising professionals, will not be included.
For Rupert Murdoch, the owner of The Journal since 2007, the partnership is a way for him to realize his long-held dream of turning the paper into something of interest to readers beyond Wall Street and corporate boardrooms.
The mogul was the driving force behind the Apple deal, according to two executives close to Mr. Murdoch. He wants The Journal to include more general interest, sports and lifestyle coverage, and the partnership with Apple gives the paper a concrete reason to move beyond its core readership.
Unswayed by sentiment, Mr. Murdoch, 88, recently sold off the bulk of his television and film properties as he refocused on the news business and reshaped his empire into an entity built to survive the final steps of the digital revolution. He was able to extract better terms from Apple than other publishers, the people close to him said, including the ability to exit on a time frame that would be more favorable to The Journal.
Mr. Murdoch has worked with Apple in the past. In 2011, when tablets were supposedly going to save journalism, he poured millions into an iPad publication, The Daily, with the help of Apple’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs. The effort failed to make its mark and was shut down after less than two years.
Publications that originated at the now defunct Time Inc. — like Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune — are also part of Apple News Plus. They were pushed into the arrangement as part of a deal struck by Meredith, the company that purchased them in 2017, according to two news executives familiar with the matter. Although Meredith sold Time and Fortune last year and is looking to move Sports Illustrated, the three publications appear to be locked in to Apple News Plus, at least for the time being. (Meredith and Apple declined to comment.)
The economics of Apple’s venture will vary from title to title. After the company takes half the subscription price, its partners will split the rest. How much each media company receives is based on the amount of time readers devote to its content. That model mimics Spotify and Apple Music, which pay record labels based on how often their tracks are streamed.
The visibility of individual articles will depend on Apple’s algorithm, which takes into account a user’s preference — you can “follow” a particular magazine or topic — as well as the judgments of Lauren Kern, the editor in chief of Apple News, and her team.
In contrast with Google and Facebook, Apple has promoted the human touch. The presence of Ms. Kern, a former editor at New York magazine, has to some degree assuaged publishers’ fears of algorithmic tyranny.
“Lauren being there gives me confidence, but it’s not that she knows who we are, but that she knows what great content is,” said Ms. Wasserstein, of New York Media.
Although Ms. Kern provides a link between the news media and Silicon Valley, Apple will also have to get used to the journalists now associated with its team. The New Yorker weighed in on the Cupertino event with a satirical story headlined “Tim Cook’s Big Apple Circus.”
Apple got another taste of what it has signed up for after it hosted a private party last week for its new partners at the company’s Lower Manhattan loft. In its coverage of the event, Vanity Fair, one of those partners, included a quote from an unnamed partygoer who summed up the mood of the room and, perhaps, the industry at large.
The quote became the story’s headline: “Are we at a party, or a wake?”

(Reuters) - A family of eight known as the "Hart Tribe" died last year in a murder-suicide when their sports utility vehicle plunged off a 100-foot (30 m) cliff in northern California, a coroner's inquest said on Thursday.
The mystery over why the family from Washington state perished in March last year on a scenic cliffside highway, about 180 miles (290 kms) north of San Francisco, garnered national attention.
A 14-member jury ruled that the deaths were the result of a "murder-suicide", Mendocino County Sheriff-Coroner Thomas Allman told a press conference late Thursday after a two-day inquest.
"This was held so the truth can come out," he said. "We needed to know the facts of this case."
The eight family members - two women and their six adopted children - are believed to have been in the GMC Yukon in March 2018 when it accelerated to about 90 mph (144 kph) and drove over a cliff, authorities said.
The bodies of Jennifer Hart and her partner Sarah Margaret Hart, both 38, were found in the vehicle which landed upside down, police said. 
The children were Markis, 19; Hannah, 16; Devonte, 15; Jeremiah, 14; Abigail, 14; and Ciera, 12.
The bodies of four children were later recovered. A fifth child was linked by DNA to human remains found in a shoe on the coast about one mile (1.6 km) north of the crash site.
The remains of Devonte have never been found, Allman said.
Devonte, an African-American, drew international attention in 2014 when he was photographed embracing a white police officer at a rally to protest the shooting of a black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.
The two Hart women died by suicide, Allman said. The deaths of the six children were ruled to be murders.
There was no known motive, Allman said.
Jennifer Hart is thought to have driven the car off the cliff three days after child protective services in Washington state opened an investigation into allegations she and her partner had neglected or abused the children.
A police autopsy has shown that Jennifer Hart was legally drunk at the time of the crash.
Three children, along with Sarah Hart, tested positive for an ingredient commonly found in the allergy drug Benadryl, which can make people sleepy, the sheriff's office has said. 
"The Hart family is hopefully resting in peace," Allman said in officially closing the case.

WASHINGTON — For Donald Trump, the rigid rules of golf are flexible, allowing for the kick of a wayward ball into a better location, skipping a putt that looks close enough. What's the big deal?
That is according to Rick Reilly, a former Sports Illustrated columnist who has just written the book "Commander in Cheat," which alleges Trump is guilty of all sorts of sins on the golf course.
In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Reilly laid out a number of accusations to support his view that the U.S. president's golf game is, well, not par for the course, particularly for a president who owns a string of golf resorts.
Among the charges: Playing with pros Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Brad Faxon in November 2017, Trump hit two balls in the water on one hole but didn't charge himself any penalty strokes.
The pros all saw it happen, but just grinned their way through it. Why didn't they call him out for the violation?
"Because he's so fun and we want our own stories to tell about the cheating," Reilly said he was told.
At Winged Foot, a famous golf club in Westchester County, New York, Trump had a reputation among the caddies for kicking his ball into a better position so often that they called him "Pele," the former soccer star, Reilly said.
While Trump has in the past claimed a golf handicap of 2.8, meaning he typically will average three strokes over par over 18 holes, his handicap is actually about 10, said Reilly.
"This idea that Donald Trump is a great golfer - he's not," said Reilly. "He's good. He’s a 72-year-old man who’s a 10 handicap. That’s pretty good. But why isn’t that good enough?"
One time Democrat Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the 2016 election, had her brother, Hugh Rodham, to play a round at Winged Foot but showed up wearing shorts and was told he had to have long pants, Reilly said.
Rodham ended up wearing Trump's rain pants in order to meet the dress code, and gave them back when he was done. This didn't sit well with Trump when he found out about it.
"Somebody tells Trump this and he was so mad he made the club buy him a whole new rain suit," said Reilly.
Reilly said the point of the book is to show what Trump is really like behind the scenes.
"Golf is a window into a guy’s soul and this gives a pretty good view of the guy," he said.
The White House declined to comment.

BERLIN — A girl on an East German cooperative farm beaten by her father, then raped and traded for sex by her brother. An emotionally troubled boy undressed in "counseling sessions" by a priest at his boarding school. A swimmer abused by his instructor.
These are just three of hundreds of stories revealed by Germany's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which issued an interim report on Wednesday after three years' work.
The 350-page report, based on testimony from 1,690 people, called for an end to taboos around discussing abuse, so people who had been failed as children should not suffer in adulthood.
But inquiry chair Sabine Andresen, an education professor, warned the inquiry had more to do, with the disabled and children in competitive sport being vulnerable groups the inquiry had not yet reached.
Whether because of their identification with a sport, or their successes in it, such children were often reluctant to come forward, her colleague Brigitte Tillmann said.
Abuse was often hereditary, the inquiry found, with family memories of war or Nazi crimes often at the root of abuse generations later.
Recommendations to the government centred on building support networks for victims to share stories and letting them pay for therapy with health insurance.
The inquiry, part of a global wave of accounting for abuse suffered by children at the hands of institutions of power and prestige, from the Catholic Church to university sports teams, was set up by the German government.
Some 83 percent of the victims it identified were female and more than half had suffered abuse within their family. Almost half were less than six when the abuse began.
The inquiry was originally intended to run for three years but has had its mandate extended to investigate other areas and come up with more concrete proposals for remedies.
"For people like me who had to experience sexual abuse as children, the work of the commission gives us hope," said Hjoerdis Wirth, a member of a victims' advisory board. "Finally to be noticed, to have the effects on our lives acknowledged."
For many victims the inquiry was a chance to address decades-old pain, as was the case with "Andreas" (a pseudonym), who was abused by his swimming instructor.
"I've never swam since then, even though it was my favourite thing," he wrote. "But the worst thing is that years of my childhood are missing. I know what he did back then, but I can't remember the two years before and after. I don't remember the good things."

The series finale of “You’re the Worst” is on FXX. And “Brockmire” is back for a third season on IFC.
YOU’RE THE WORST 10 p.m. on FXX.  As do many comedies, this bawdy sitcom ends its final season with a marriage. Probably. In the previous season, Gretchen (Aya Cash), a publicist with clinical depression, ditched a riskless relationship and proposed to her more exciting (if uncongenial) writer love interest, Jimmy (Chris Geere). The lead-up to the wedding this season has been peppered with flash-forwards suggesting the two may not ultimately be bound in holy matrimony — but as of now, the wedding is still on. In his review of the season for The New York Times, Mike Hale called the show “one of the most twisted, acidulous and sex-drenched” romantic comedies on TV, writing that Wednesday’s finale “answers the questions and satisfies the emotions without short-selling the serious issues.”
GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (2014) 7:30 p.m. on FX. The ’80s nostalgia pours out like stuffing from a ripped Cabbage Patch Kids doll in this witty Marvel space comedy. Chris Pratt stars as a charming galactic cowboy, alongside Zoe Saldana as an elite assassin and Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper — who do the voices of an animated tree-man and racoonish bounty hunter. The movie plainly shares some D.N.A. with the sci-fi parody GALAXY QUEST (1999), which is coincidentally showing at 8:30 p.m. and 10:45 p.m. on BBC America. That film stars Tim Allen, Sigourney Weaver and Alan Rickman as members of a crew of actors from a canceled cult sci-fi series who are thrust into an actual space war. Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times in 1999 that “Galaxy Quest” spoofs franchises like “Star Trek” while also managing to “replicate the very elements that have made them so durable.” That applies to “Guardians of the Galaxy,” too.
BROCKMIRE 10 p.m. on IFC. Spring training season is upon Jim Brockmire, the disgraced sports announcer played by Hank Azaria in this comedy series. The start of Season 3 has Brockmire gearing up for a big opportunity: taking over as an anchor for the Oakland Athletics. Anyone who saw where “Brockmire” began knows how big a jump that is. The first season started with Azaria’s character having a career-breaking meltdown during a live broadcast, then cut forward years later, with Brockmire deciding to get back in the game. This season Brockmire is working alongside a new co-host, Gabby (Tawny Newsome), and delivering lines like “It is a beautiful spring afternoon for baseball here at King Venom Vape Cartridge Stadium.”
THE SHINING (1980) Stream on Hulu; rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. In her review of Jordan Peele’s “Us” for The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote that “The Shining” serves as Peele’s “most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually.” Peele’s homages are of course just the latest flashes of this Stanley Kubrick horror film’s enduring influence. It’s the kind of movie where even the opening credits — projected over snaking aerial shots of a yellow Volkswagen — are distinctive.

Before reading the article:
Do you like playing video games? Why?
What’s your favorite game? Do you have a favorite game system or game controller?
Watch this commercial for the new Xbox Adaptive Controller by Microsoft: “We All Win.” What did you learn from the commercial? Do you think it is an effective ad? Who do you think is its intended audience?
Now, read the article, “Adaptive Video Game Controllers Open Worlds for Gamers With Disabilities,” and answer the following questions: 
1. The article begins, “Erin Hawley grew up immersed in video games.” What evidence does the author provide to support that statement? How did Ms. Hawley’s muscular dystrophy make it difficult to continue playing video games with increasingly complex gameplay?
2. Compare the modern controller to what the author describes as a “gaming relic.” How does the Xbox Adaptive Controller better meet the needs of people with certain disabilities than most modern controllers?
3. Before Microsoft’s new controller, how did the gamer community — especially gamers with disabilities — adapt video game technology to meet the needs of diverse users?
4. How has the Adaptive Controller affected the lives of gamers with disabilities like Ms. Hawley?
5. Why will the new controller’s versatility also be attractive to the broader community of gamers, including professional gamers, according to Bryce Johnson, Microsoft’s inclusive lead for product research and accessibility?
6. The article concludes with a quotation from Mark Barlet, a disabled Air Force veteran and founder of AbleGamers:
If you’re on the streets, everyone knows you’re a profoundly disabled individual. You can’t hide this fact. But in a video game, you’re a player. We all jump into video games for some level of fantasy.
Do you agree with Mr. Barlet? Are video games a way to escape the limitations of everyday life and jump into fantasy? What draws you to video games?
Finally, tell us more about what you think:
— What did you learn from the article? What was most interesting or surprising to you? In what ways do video games in general, and controllers in particular, meet or not meet your needs? Do you think you would want to use the Xbox Adaptive Controller?
— What role do video games have in your life? Do you consider yourself a gamer? Or are you just an occasional player? In what ways has gaming opened up new worlds for you? What life lessons has gaming taught you?
— How would you redesign your favorite game, console or controller to be more accessible to gamers with a range of different needs?
— In 2010, Congress passed the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act, which requires companies to make computers, smartphones, gaming consoles and other technology accessible to people with disabilities. What industries, companies and products would you like to see create or redesign products to better meet the diverse needs of its users?

Dr. Regina Maree Myers and Joshua Alexander Kulick were married March 30 at the Loews Hotel in Philadelphia. Rabbi Stacy Rigler officiated.
The bride, 32, is a fellow in pediatric hematology/oncology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In July, she is to receive a master’s degree in clinical epidemiology from the University of Pennsylvania. She graduated from Cornell with honors, and received a medical degree from Yale.
She is a daughter of Beatrice Myers and Alexander Myers of Bayside, Queens. The bride’s father is a manager for a Walgreens Pharmacy in Manhattan and is the former president and chief executive of Alexander Pharmacy, which was also in Manhattan. Her mother, a former senior producer of the NBC “Today” show in New York, is now a freelance television producer.
The groom, 35, is the director of software systems at Independence Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust in Philadelphia. He also serves as board president of Allens Lane Art Center, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit arts organization. He graduated magna cum laude from Lehigh.
He is the son of Anita Kellerman Kulick and Joel David Kulick of Dresher, Pa. The groom’s mother is the president and chief executive of Educating Communities for Parenting, a social service nonprofit organization in Philadelphia. His father is an independent commercial real estate appraiser and investment broker, also in Philadelphia.
Ms. Myers and Mr. Kulick met through a dating app Sept. 24, 2016 — shortly after each had moved to Philadelphia from New York — and went on a first date to a bar later that evening. He said he knew the first date would be different when she crossed the street and walked toward him.
“I remember the voice in my head telling me that I needed to do everything in my power to ensure that this first date led to a second,” he said.
Long before the bar and their conversation had shut down for the evening, Mr. Kulick had indeed secured his second date with Ms. Myers. He mentioned that Beyoncé would be performing in Philadelphia the following week, and slyly asked if she would go with him if he had tickets.
Ms. Myers said yes, and a short while later, when she excused herself to go to the restroom, Mr. Kulick quickly bought tickets for the Beyoncé concert on StubHub. He showed them to Ms. Myers when she returned. “I was like, ‘What!’ Ms. Myers recalled. “I was just incredulous.”
They began dating almost immediately. Their first few months were filled with a dizzying blitz of concerts, sports events and long walks exploring Philadelphia’s food scene.
Ms. Myers was not as certain as Mr. Kulick about a future together. But on their third date, he brought along a bouquet of flowers and he told her why: “Because I like you and it’s a nice thing to do.”
“I was a jaded New Yorker when it came to the dating scene,” she said. “I always seemed to go for the life-of-the-party guys, the loudest guys in the room. Then Joshua comes along and though he’s sort of quiet and a bit introverted, he’s the sweetest, most thoughtful and generous person I had ever met. My family loved him and so did my friends.”
And so did she, a fact she could no longer ignore.
“Within a few months, our connection was undeniable,” she said. “We had the best time together and seamlessly fit into each other’s lives, but also were not afraid to challenge each other and support each other through personal and professional obstacles.”

Seattle is feeling the pain from Boeing’s 737 Max crisis, but the aircraft manufacturer has weathered other tough challenges.

SEATTLE — Just south of Seattle’s Boeing Field and the Museum of Flight sits another shrine to aviation, Randy’s Restaurant. Model airplanes are suspended from the 24-hour diner’s ceiling, with flight manuals and various dog-eared aerospace tomes strewn about its candy-colored booths.
Given its proximity to a major outpost of the Boeing Company, Randy’s has served more than its fair share of chicken-fried steak and brick-shaped hash browns to Boeing employees and their families, among them Ron Russell.
Mr. Russell’s son works at Boeing’s aircraft assembly plant in the city of Everett, where he used to install doors on 747s. His mother also worked for Boeing. He doesn’t have to think back too far to remember 1971, when a global economic slowdown and skyrocketing oil prices prompted the company to lay off more than half its work force, sending Seattle into a tailspin.
Now, as the company grapples with a pair of fatal crashes involving its most popular airplane, the 737 Max, Mr. Russell points to Boeing’s record of resilience as proof that it will be able to overcome the latest troubles. Will its engineers be able to design a solution to the technical conundrum that threatens the company’s best-selling jet ever, which now has been grounded worldwide? “Sure,” Mr. Russell said, without missing a beat.
A total of 189 people died aboard a Lion Air flight that went down in Indonesia in October 2018, while a second fatal Max crash in Ethiopia last month claimed 157 lives. On Friday, as preliminary findings from the Ethiopia crash cast further doubt on Boeing’s instructions to pilots flying the new Max planes, the company announced that it would reduce monthly production of its 737 jets to 42 a month from 52.
[Read more about Boeing’s decision to slow production of the 737.]
It is hard to find a place in Seattle where people don’t have some personal or family connection to the giant aircraft manufacturer, the largest private employer in Washington state, and that means plenty of people worried about whether the back-to-back crashes will affect orders for a plane upon which the company has banked much of its near-term future.
The company is everywhere: Boeing Field, just south of downtown Seattle, is still used for testing and delivery of Boeing planes. Wide-body jets are assembled at the company’s giant factory in Everett, to the north. The 737s are put together at the 1.1 million-square-foot plant in Renton, 12 miles southeast of downtown Seattle. Renton is also home to the headquarters of Boeing’s commercial airplane group.
“One of my very best friends from first grade, both his parents worked for Boeing,” said Ed Prince, a City Council member in Renton. “Seattle, for so many years, was a company town — Boeing was it.”
Where downtown Seattle is booming with expensive high-rise condo towers, Renton, a suburb of slightly more than 100,000 people, still sports single-family homes in its small-townish core. The city’s population tripled during World War II, and “Boeing was a huge part of that,” said Elizabeth Stewart, executive director of the Renton History Museum.
The one-way roads that permeate downtown Renton are, said Ms. Stewart, a relic of World War II-era Boeing, which lobbied for the street grid so it could get workers in and out more quickly.
“They’ve been here for over 75 years; they’re iconic for our city,” said Renton’s mayor, Denis Law. “There was a period of time where there were very few people in the immediate region who either didn’t work for the Boeing Company or knew someone who did.”
These days, though, Boeing is no longer the only fish in the Cedar River, which flows beneath Renton’s downtown library.
The city has welcomed a number of new health care companies, as well as high-tech companies like Wizards of the Coast and industrial stalwarts like Paccar, the truck manufacturer. Across the street from Boeing’s Renton plant, on Lake Washington’s southern waterfront, is a new 712,000-square-foot office complex that city officials hope will attract new high-tech tenants.
Some of those one-way streets are being transformed into two-way streets.
Still, the question of what caused the crash of the two 737s and whether Boeing engineers bear any responsibility has been a near-constant topic of conversation — along with questions about a company that has changed significantly since many old-timers around town worked there. The company’s corporate headquarters moved to Chicago in 2001. Some aircraft parts are now manufactured as far away as Asia.
Since countries grounded the Max plane, and after Boeing paused deliveries of new jets, a backlog has been created on its production lines in Renton.
Boeing employees are not allowed to publicly discuss the crash investigations, so many of those outside must rely on snippets of information from friends, or news reports. Lately, many of those reports have focused on an automated system designed to prevent stalls that may have caused the pilots to lose control of the planes — though no definitive cause has been determined.
Greg Langmann, 60, who spent 35 years with the company as an engineer before retiring in 2017, said he came to believe that the culture at the company was in need of revamping.
“Decisions at Boeing are typically conducted in tribal fashion, rather than openly using reason and logic,” said Mr. Langmann, who worked in offices down the street from the Renton plant for much of his career. “Project management, a focus at Boeing, should be more than managing cost and schedule,” he said. “You should understand something of the project. Otherwise you can’t manage product performance, value or safety.”
On Friday, when it announced the slowdown of its production of the 737, the company also said it would establish a new committee on its board of directors to review how it develops and builds aircraft.
Dave Hayes is a recently retired Boeing pilot who moved to the Seattle area more than a decade ago from California, where he worked for Northwest Airlines. He was hunched over a pale ale one recent afternoon at Trencher’s, a sports bar in a large mixed-use complex called The Landing, which opened in 2007 on what used to be Boeing property in Renton.
Mr. Hayes is still in close contact with his ex-colleagues, who he says are concerned about the prospect of increased oversight by Congress and the Federal Aviation Administration in the wake of criticism that the F.A.A. allowed Boeing to do much of its own safety analysis.
“My personal opinion is Congress has never provided funding to the F.A.A. to give them in-depth knowledge of how some of the intricate systems of airplanes work,” said Mr. Hayes. “They’re not as involved on a daily basis as the pilots and engineers at Boeing are.”
On a recent afternoon at Liberty Park in Renton, several people had gathered for a high-school baseball game, and once again, talk turned to the crash inquiries and the increasing signs that Boeing’s design could have played a role.
“They will bounce back. They’re No. 1. They just let a money issue cloud their mind,” said Mario Terrell, a wellness nurse who comes from a family that includes several current and former Boeing workers — including his mother. He said he fears the company cut corners to save money. “My mom’s very upset,” he said.
That she is. Jacquelyn Terrell, now 86, was a longtime shop steward at Boeing’s Renton plant and is still in touch with many of her former co-workers and the union.
“Everyone is shocked,” she said. “That’s not Boeing. Something’s wrong. They need to dig further. There’s a lack of pilot training.”
Having seen many of the troubles the company has faced in past years, most people here seem to expect that whatever the current problem, Boeing’s designers will, as they always have, engineer a way out of it.
Mr. Russell, who used to build truck cabs for a Paccar subsidiary in Renton and Seattle, recalled “the battery fiasco” in 2013, when it was discovered that the batteries in Boeing’s just-rolled-out 787 Dreamliner were prone to overheating; it led to a three-month grounding of the plane. Boeing, he noted, swiftly developed a fix and got the fleet back on track.
“It was a big deal,” Mr. Russell said. “But they made a bigger deal out of it than it was.”

MAPASTEPEC, Mexico — Tempers frayed among hundreds of mostly Central American migrants gathered on Wednesday in southern Mexico, delayed as Mexican officials sought to slow down the U.S.-bound flow that President Donald Trump is determined to turn back.
Since last week Trump has repeatedly threatened to close down the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexican officials do not do more to thwart the migrants, potentially harming tens of billions of dollars in trade, but has also praised Mexican efforts following his outbursts.
The Mexican government has vehemently denied changing policy in response to threats, but has appeared to slam the brakes on its practice of awarding so-called humanitarian visas that allow migrants from other countries to pass freely within its borders.
Without such papers, they are vulnerable to harassment and deportation from officials.
As many as 1,500 men, women and children traveling in a large group or caravan from Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Cuba were gathered in the town of Mapastepec in Chiapas state, unable to obtain the temporary visas.
Mexico's immigration institute said it would prioritize giving the visas to vulnerable groups including the elderly and unaccompanied minors, while offering transport home for others.
Officials were issuing very few of the documents, migrants said, and frustrations were mounting as a result.
"It's been hard for me to get here because there aren't any visas," said Cuban migrant Yuremi Garcia, who had traveled without papers from the southern Mexican border a few hours south to a crowded sports ground in Mapastepec, converted into a temporary shelter. 
Garcia said he was tired of waiting and had decided to continue northwards together with others, despite the risk that Mexican authorities would deport them.
At the border town of Tapachula, near the southern tip of Mexico bordering Guatemala, another group included people from Sri Lanka, Congo and Haiti, a federal official said. Some migrants said Mexican officials had slowed down the process of awarding the visas or denied them outright without providing any explanation.
A small group lashed out at border officials in Tapachula on Tuesday over the delays, throwing rocks and breaking windows of a local migration institute building.
Edgar Corso, an official with Mexico's human rights commission, told Reuters that some 45 complaints filed with the commission by Cuban migrants since March 15 allege unreasonable delays in awarding the visas.
He said the attack on the migration office has also been formally documented.
Last week, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has steadfastly avoided any public confrontation with Trump, said he would help ensure more orderly migration.
In December-February, his administration's first three months, Mexico sent home 19,360 migrants, 17 percent fewer than a year earlier, data from the National Migration Institute show.
In response to Trump's pressure, the government has been providing daily updates to U.S. officials on how it is acting more aggressively to halt migration flows, and providing specific numbers on how many people are being apprehended, a senior White House official said. 
"They've shown that they are increasing what they are doing," the official said on Tuesday, asking not to be named in order to speak freely.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and officials at the State Department have been in regular contact with Mexican officials about their efforts, the official said.
Lopez Obrador told reporters on Wednesday at his regular morning news conference that his administration was "acting with an abundance of prudence," saying a border shutdown was in nobody's interest.
"We are looking to ensure that the law is respected," he added.

This is Part 2 of a three-part story. Go back and read Part 1.
In a matter of months, Rupert Murdoch had married a former supermodel, led Britain’s historic vote to break with the European Union and played a pivotal role in the American election. He now had a close relationship with the British prime minister, Theresa May, and an even closer one with the incoming American president, Donald J. Trump. But his media empire was more vulnerable than ever. Netflix, Amazon, Apple and a host of other new technology companies were streaming content directly to consumers and were growing at unabated rates across the globe. It was an overwhelming existential challenge to legacy media companies like 21st Century Fox. Once viewed as a global colossus, Murdoch’s empire was now in danger of being too small. He desperately needed international scale to compete. The answer seemed obvious: The Murdochs had to take full control of Sky.
With annual revenues of some $16 billion, Sky was the largest pay-TV provider in Britain and across Europe. The Murdochs currently owned only 39 percent of it, and that share already generated the company three times the revenue of Fox News. What’s more, Sky had its own 24-hour news channel in Britain, Sky News, which could be built into a global news network to take on the Murdochs’ longtime rival, the publicly financed BBC.
For James, who would be leading the Sky acquisition, the potential deal also represented something more personal: an opportunity for redemption. He tried to buy Sky five years earlier, in part by forging a close alliance with David Cameron, then a Conservative member of Parliament who was eyeing the prime ministership. What began with Cameron’s dropping by a Murdoch family vacation near the Greek isle of Santorini turned into a mutually beneficial friendship between James and the candidate. The aims of both parties were clear. Cameron wanted the support of the Murdochs. James wanted Ofcom, the British regulatory agency that would rule on whether the Murdochs were “fit and proper” operators of Sky, out of his way. With the 2010 election approaching, Cameron publicly promised that under a Conservative government, “Ofcom as we know it will cease to exist.” Not long after, James summoned Cameron to the George, a private club in the Mayfair area of London, to tell him that The Sun would reverse 12 years of support for the Labor Party and endorse him. (James and Cameron have each denied that there was any quid pro quo for the endorsement.) But just as James was getting all of the pieces in place, the phone-hacking scandal broke. He and his father were hauled in front of Parliament, and James was forced to withdraw their $12 billion bid for Sky. Ofcom survived.

Lachlan and others inside 21st Century Fox were concerned about James’s leading this second Sky bid, given how closely associated he had been with the hacking scandal and with the family’s first failed attempt to gain full control of the satellite company. But James, who knew the company best, was adamant, and in December 2016, he struck a new deal with the owners of Sky. The lawyers for 21st Century Fox, Allen & Overy, sent a lengthy memo to Karen Bradley, Britain’s secretary of state for culture, media and sport, detailing why this bid was different from the earlier one. Not only had the Murdochs shut down The News of the World, the newspaper that had been found guilty of widespread hacking; they had also divided the empire into two different entities: News Corp and 21st Century Fox. The company that would be purchasing Sky, 21st Century Fox, had thus been separated from the family’s newspapers. Further, the lawyers wrote that the company’s culture had changed substantially since the hacking scandal: It “has adopted strong governance measures and controls to ensure it meets the highest standards of corporate conduct.” James expressed similar confidence on a conference call with Wall Street analysts: “We do think that this passes regulatory muster,” he said.
One other factor made the proposed deal especially attractive. Thanks to Brexit, the Murdochs would be getting full ownership of Sky at the steeply discounted price of $14.8 billion if the deal went through. The British government was paralyzed, unable to reach an agreement to implement the break with the European bloc. Foreign companies were pulling out of Britain, destabilizing the country’s job market and the economy and, in turn, significantly depressing the value of the English pound — and with it, the price of Sky’s shares.
All that needed to happen was for the government to approve the deal. With the Sky bid once again pending before Ofcom, James embarked on a campaign of contrition and humility designed to convince the British establishment that he and his family business could be trusted to own Sky.
Even as James was pursuing his bid to take full control of Sky in Britain, the company’s Australian division — Lachlan’s domain — was closing a much smaller but still significant deal for the family to take full control of a different Sky subsidiary: Sky News Australia, which it jointly owned with two Australian media companies. It was the country’s only 24-hour cable news channel and an unexploited opportunity for influence on another continent.
The Murdochs’ newspaper holdings accounted for some 60 percent of the Australian print market, and included the country’s sole national general-interest paper, The Australian. As the face of this continental newspaper empire, Lachlan wielded an enormous amount of political power in the country. Over the previous decade, Murdoch papers helped push out two different prime ministers, Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. When Gillard’s treasurer, Wayne Swan, was worried that the Murdoch attacks were hurting the national economy, he sought out Lachlan to make an appeal, Swan told us. Lachlan built alliances, too, drawing close to Tony Abbott, a member of Parliament whose right-wing politics and confrontational style had earned him frequent comparisons to Newt Gingrich. When Abbott served as prime minister, from 2013 to 2015, he would discuss legislation with the Murdochs’ editors — and occasionally the Murdochs themselves — before introducing it, the former editor of The Australian, Chris Mitchell, wrote in his memoir.
Now Murdoch’s Australian empire was expanding into cable news. The country’s dominant broadcaster was the Australian Broadcast Corporation, a publicly financed institution modeled after the BBC. Its reporting was similarly straight and sober. Sky News Australia — which also airs in New Zealand — was, notionally, a competitor, but its audience was small, even by Australian standards. Still, the network offered Lachlan his own opportunity for redemption: After his split with his father, he presided over the implosion of the Australian TV network Ten. His failed efforts to save it included giving a reality-TV dance show to his wife and signing off on a weekly show for a controversial right-wing firebrand, Andrew Bolt. A columnist at the Murdoch-owned Herald Sun, Bolt had impressed Lachlan years earlier at a company retreat in Pebble Beach, Calif., when he aggressively questioned Al Gore after Gore presented his slide show on climate change. When Bolt was awarded his show on Ten, he was facing charges for violating the country’s Racial Discrimination Act by writing that light-skinned Aborigines were claiming indigenous status for personal gain. (Bolt was found guilty, and the publisher was forced to print a lengthy statement acknowledging the offense.)


With the acquisition of Sky News Australia, Lachlan would have a second chance. The Murdochs won full control of the network in December 2016, while James’s Sky deal in Britain was still pending. Sky News Australia’s programming had historically been politically balanced. But as the Murdochs’ takeover approached, the network began increasing the amount of right-wing commentary it broadcast during prime time.
Not long before the deal closed, Lachlan’s old Ten host Andrew Bolt was brought in to do a nightly political program. Immediately after the purchase, Sky signed up as a host and commentator Caroline Marcus, a columnist for The Daily Telegraph of Sydney who had supported a ban on burkinis in France and lamented what she described as reverse discrimination against whites in cultural debates. Ross Cameron — a former member of the Australian Parliament prone to anti-gay slurs who later spoke at an event hosted by a far-right organization that describes itself as Australia’s leading anti-Islamic group — co-hosted a program called “The Outsiders.” He and his fellow hosts described themselves as “Trump’s Aussie mates” and half-joked that their show would provide “absolutely no balance whatsoever.” After one host, Mark Latham, was fired for making a series of offensive comments, including a homophobic remark about a high school student who participated in a video for International Women’s Day, he ran successfully for state office as a member of One Nation, the country’s far-right anti-immigrant party. Soon after Lachlan took over, an old political ally, Tony Abbott’s former chief of staff, Peta Credlin, became a prime-time host on Sky. Still closely allied with Abbott, she used her platform to argue that Australia should slow down its efforts to combat climate change, take a stricter line on immigration and resist the liberal drift of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a bitter Abbott rival.
Known as Sky After Dark, the opinion-heavy, almost-uniformly right-wing lineup was an entirely new phenomenon in Australian TV. Its nighttime ratings spiked as the network quickly became required viewing for the country’s political class.
By the early months of 2017, Murdoch’s interim leadership of Fox News, which started with Ailes’s ouster before the election, was now beginning to look permanent. He installed beneath him two of Ailes’s loyal deputies: Jack Abernethy, who was in charge of operations, and Bill Shine, a close friend of Hannity’s who had been overseeing the opinion lineup but would now also run the entire news operation. Neither was known for his independent thinking. A rival executive called Shine “the butler” because of his uncanny tendency to appear at Ailes’s side to address his needs. Even as Murdoch was elevating Shine, numerous accusations — some of them in lawsuits against Ailes — were surfacing that Shine had protected and even enabled Ailes during his years of allegedly sexually harassing women at the network. (Shine has denied any wrongdoing.)
After the election, Murdoch moved even more forcefully to support Trump. When Greta Van Susteren, a former CNN host and a somewhat ideologically unpredictable presence in the Fox lineup, left the network, Murdoch enthusiastically endorsed the idea of replacing her at 7 p.m. with Tucker Carlson — a conservative writer and a founder of the Daily Caller website who was earning praise from white nationalists heading into Trump’s election. Murdoch marked the occasion by taking Carlson out to brunch with Jerry Hall in New York. When Megyn Kelly, who sealed her fame by clashing with Trump, left Fox in early 2017, Murdoch opted not to replace her with another Trump antagonist.
Murdoch also kept in close touch with the White House. He and Kushner had always spoken frequently, but now he was in regular contact with Trump too. Trump enjoyed getting his calls. As someone who prized wealth and power, Trump had long admired Murdoch; for decades, it had invariably been Trump who called Murdoch, asking for help. Now it was Murdoch reaching out to Trump on a regular basis. “Rupert, Rupert!” Trump would say, talking on the phone with Murdoch in the Oval Office, according to a former White House official who overheard the conversations. “You love the action, don’t you? You can’t get enough of this shit.”
Trump was also spending a lot of time on the phone with Hannity, who regularly called the president after his show. Trump had often found him to be too much of a supplicant for his purposes: He preferred his more combative interviews with Bill O’Reilly, which he felt better showcased his pugnaciousness, according to a former White House official. But Trump appreciated Hannity’s loyalty. The Fox host had effectively been a member of his campaign team, for instance pressing Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, to be on the lookout for former girlfriends and employees who might make trouble for the candidate ahead of the election, two people familiar with the interactions told us. (Hannity, through a Fox representative, denies having done so.) His show became a nightly hourlong campaign infomercial. Hannity’s audience was Trump’s most devoted base. In an interview with The New York Times, Ailes once described Hannity as presiding over a “segmented” show whose appeal was limited to hard-core conservatives. Now he was the network’s biggest star. He set the tone for the rest of Fox’s opinion lineup, which quickly became a nightly counterpoint to the mainstream media’s coverage of Trump.
As a former media adviser, Ailes recognized that the Fox News brand depended on the perception that it was a credible alternative to the liberal media. He would even sometimes rein in his opinion hosts when their rhetoric threatened to undermine that perception. Ailes also thought that presenting a monolithic view night after night was bad television. He was careful to make sure that the network always had some hosts who challenged Republican orthodoxy at least occasionally.
These were matters that did not appear to concern Murdoch. Some of the network’s news anchors could deliver at times stark counterprogramming to opinion hosts like Hannity. Shepard Smith became increasingly pointed in his critical coverage of Trump, expressing disbelief at the “lie after lie after lie” coming from the administration; the Fox anchor Chris Wallace emerged as one of the toughest interrogators of Trump surrogates and officials on television; and Bret Baier’s straight coverage regularly infuriated Trump. But the network’s prime-time lineup is its biggest draw, and by the fall of 2017, that lineup was notably more pro-Trump than it was under Ailes, with Carlson at 8, Hannity at 9 and the right-wing radio star Laura Ingraham at 10. They were joined, of course, by the morning hosts on “Fox & Friends,” the show with which Trump always started his day.
Years earlier, when James was fighting in Britain for the first failed Sky deal, he expressed contempt for government meddling in the media’s affairs and impugned the nationally esteemed BBC as a “chilling” media monolith. “The only reliable, durable and perpetual guarantor of independence,” he said in a lecture at the annual Edinburgh International Television Festival, “is profit.” In the spring of 2017, as James made the rounds with civic and business leaders in London, he took a far more conciliatory tack. He praised the BBC and assured former critics that he respected Britain’s strict regulations designed to ensure impartiality in England’s news coverage. At an annual conference held by the influential media analyst Claire Enders, a leading critic of his first Sky bid, James professed an “aspiration for us to be better” and promised to “behave in the way that we imagined we would want to and be expected to in the future.”
Even as James was in the midst of this campaign, the company’s behavior was once again threatening to jeopardize the Sky deal. In April 2017, The New York Times reported that the Fox News host Bill O’Reilly and the network had doled out some $13 million to address multiple complaints from women about O’Reilly’s lewd comments and unwanted advances and that Fox had nevertheless renewed his contract for $25 million. Ofcom was soon receiving submissions from O’Reilly’s victims. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing one of his accusers, drew a direct link between Fox’s sexual-harassment scandals and the phone hacking: Both, she wrote, revealed “a lack of oversight, intervention and decency.”
After James and several other senior executives from 21st Century Fox were grilled about the company’s culture by Ofcom regulators in the agency’s headquarters overlooking the Thames, the Murdochs scrambled to protect their Sky bid. They quickly fired O’Reilly, giving him a $25 million exit package. When rumors started circulating that Ailes’s once-loyal lieutenant, Shine, might be next, Hannity tried to protect him, sensing that his old friend and ally was about to become a victim of the Murdochs’ broader global agenda: “Somebody HIGH UP AND INSIDE FNC is trying to get an innocent person fired,” he tweeted, presumably referring to James. Shine was pushed out, too.
In June 2017, Ofcom finally issued its report on the acquisition: It recommended that the deal be reviewed by yet another regulatory body. The Competition and Markets Authority would investigate whether Sky would give the Murdochs too much influence over the British media.
The decision set off still more scrambling. To prevent any potential problems with the British regulators, Fox executives directed a furious Hannity to dial down his coverage of the death of a Democratic National Committee staff member named Seth Rich, which had spurred wild conspiracy theories and wide public criticism, as well as an advertiser boycott. The Murdochs also pulled Fox News off the air in Britain, where it had been the subject of several formal complaints of “unfair and inaccurate content.” (A separate investigation by British regulators found that Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson had violated British impartiality standards: Hannity for ridiculing critics of Trump’s proposed travel ban without presenting a full version of their views or giving them an opportunity to respond, and Carlson for allowing Nigel Farage to make baseless claims that British officials had failed to protect “thousands of underage girls” from rape and abuse by Muslims.)


In September 2017, James delivered the keynote address at the Royal Television Society’s annual convention in Cambridge, using the occasion to make the case for the Sky deal and to sketch out his vision for the future of the global media company that he still hoped to run. He ticked off some of 21st Century Fox’s better-known brands — National Geographic, FX, Fox Sports, Sky Atlantic — and described how these and other outlets had “explored the opioid epidemic, gender identity and race relations” and “told powerful stories of slavery in America, the rights of women in Pakistan and the coming and inevitable exploration of Mars.” Absent from his list, and from his entire address, was one of 21st Century Fox’s best-known brands, Fox News. In the question-and-answer session that followed, an interviewer speculated about why the deal was taking so long. “I wonder if the message that comes through,” she said, “is that you presided over this rotten culture at News International and, again, at Fox News, and that people just don’t trust you. Is that what you think the message is?”
That November, a bipartisan coalition of British members of Parliament took their concerns about the deal to a hearing in Victoria House on Southampton Row, the headquarters of the Competition and Markets Authority. They were led by Ed Miliband, a former leader of the Labor Party and a supporter of antimonopoly media legislation who had tangled with the Murdochs a couple of years earlier, when The Sun fulminated against his candidacy for prime minister, dubbing him Red Ed and Shameful Mili. They highlighted Fox’s promotion of the Seth Rich conspiracy and its airing of false claims that there were zones in London controlled by Shariah law. If the Murdochs gained full control of the satellite broadcast company, the M.P.s warned, they could transform its 24-hour news channel, Sky News, into a British version of Fox News. The question of the Murdochs’ influence over the media led, inevitably, to the question of the Murdochs’ influence over the country’s politics. “I know Rupert,” Ken Clarke, a member of Parliament, said. “The idea that Rupert is interested in a detached influence in the politics of the countries where he owns his media — anybody who knew him, you could not put that proposition to them without them breaking into a very broad smile.”
In January 2018, the Competition and Markets Authority issued its ruling on 21st Century Fox’s acquisition of Sky: Full ownership of the company would give the Murdochs “too much control over news providers in the U.K. across all media platforms (TV, radio, online and newspapers) and therefore too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda.” It was a full-blown repudiation, setting up a final ruling that no member of the Murdoch family should ever be allowed to serve in any capacity at Sky — not even on the company’s board. It would be an especially harsh blow to James, who was serving as Sky’s chairman at the time.
For Lachlan, it was a validation of his view that James was the wrong public face of the campaign for Sky, reminding the public of the hacking scandal and all the hostility toward the Murdochs it had stirred up. For James, the failure of the deal was a bitter vindication of his view that his family’s empire could not survive its own politics and culture.
In early August 2017, Rupert Murdoch invited Robert A. Iger, the chief executive of Disney, to Moraga, his $28.8 million Tuscan-style vineyard estate in the hills of Bel Air, and offered him a glass of wine. The two moguls commiserated about the threat they both faced from the new breed of tech giants and what they could do to confront it. Disney also wanted to get bigger. Talk about combining some of their assets soon evolved into something much more significant: a conversation about Iger’s buying 21st Century Fox, the Hollywood studio that Murdoch wrested away from the Colorado oilman Marvin Davis in 1985. For 65 years, Murdoch had been ruthlessly expanding his empire. He was now thinking about doing the most un-Murdochian thing imaginable: He was going to shrink it.
It was, in a sense, an admission of defeat. Murdoch’s ambitions had been subverted, finally and definitively, by his own failings — the family squabbles, the reactionary drift of Fox News, the Sky News debacle. But he had a new plan. He would cleave off the Hollywood studio that was responsible for about two-thirds of the company’s revenues and keep his main tools of influence, his newspapers and Fox News. James would move on, perhaps following 21st Century Fox to Disney, and he and Lachlan would run the remaining leaner, scrappier company together like a pirate ship.
The decision was driven not only by the imperatives of the business but also by those of the Murdoch family. Joint custody of the empire wasn’t working. It was easy for the company’s senior executives to see which one Murdoch preferred — Murdoch’s face would light up when Lachlan would roll his chair nearer to him at meetings — and they quickly learned which son to go to with questions and requests. (“And Lachlan?” Murdoch would ask, whenever executives told him that they had spoken to James about something.) As James saw it, his brother was mainly interested in the unique fringe benefits and trappings of power that came with the job. He bristled when Lachlan built a rock-climbing wall on an old soundstage on the studio lot and hired a private security guard to accompany him everywhere. Lachlan, meanwhile, chafed at James’s fixation on corporate governance, which he felt was inconsistent with the company’s swashbuckling spirit.
The Trump presidency was also exposing a deeper divide between the brothers. James was becoming increasingly troubled by Fox News. He didn’t object to the idea of a conservative news network, but he did object to what he felt it had evolved into at certain hours: a political weapon with no editorial standards or concern for the value of truth and a knee-jerk defender of the president’s rhetoric and policies. After Trump issued his executive order banning immigration from some Muslim-majority countries in early 2017, James pushed his father and Lachlan to agree to write a companywide memo reassuring its Muslim employees in the United States and abroad. James wanted the note to forcefully and unequivocally establish their opposition to the policy and to tell employees who felt threatened by it that the company would do everything in its power to protect them. Lachlan wanted it to be less confrontational and to not specifically mention Trump or the Muslim ban, which Fox News’s opinion hosts were defending night after night. Even getting Lachlan’s approval for the watered-down version that ultimately went out was “like pulling teeth,” James would later say privately, according to people close to him.
Months later, when Trump blamed “both sides” for the violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., saying that there were some “very fine people” among the white supremacists, Kathryn insisted that they write their own open letter of opposition, without consulting with his brother or father first. “If we’re not going to say something about [expletive] Nazis marching in Virginia, when are we going to say something?” she told James, according to a person familiar with the conversation.
Kathryn had historically kept her complaints about the network and the business inside the family, in accordance with the unofficial Murdoch code of conduct. But Fox opinion hosts’ embrace of nativism and white nationalism during Trump’s rise had eroded her restraint. Her frustration with the family business occasionally broke through on her Twitter account. She wrote supportive replies to posts from the Parkland shooting survivor and gun-control activist David Hogg — who had been taunted by Laura Ingraham over his college rejections and was leading an advertising boycott against her show — as well as from Never Trump Republicans like Bill Kristol who had left the network. And she complimented a Washington Post opinion article that noted that the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer had praised Carlson for “covering all our talking points.”
The resentment that had been steadily building between James and Lachlan over the past two and a half years exploded in the fall of 2018, as the Disney deal became a possibility, then a probability and then a reality.
James instantly seized on the idea, seeing it both as a way out of the family business and as a possible route to the biggest job in the media. He started speaking with Iger separately over lunches and meetings, discussing among other things what role he might play at Disney. Iger was in his late 60s; his contract was set to expire in the summer of 2019, and the company had not yet named a successor. A top job in Disney’s corporate hierarchy could put James in the running to take over. It had long been his dream to run his family’s empire, but Disney, when combined with 21st Century Fox, would be more than three times its size — the largest media conglomerate in the world, one with no ideological baggage to prevent it from growing and evolving further. James immediately championed the deal during his conversations with fellow 21st Century Fox board members.
Lachlan was furious. His father was talking about dismantling the empire not even three years after coaxing him back from Australia to run it, an empire that had taken a lifetime to build. He argued that 21st Century Fox was big enough to compete as it was. The smaller piece of the empire that he would be left with — a network with an aging audience in the increasingly anachronistic business of cable television — was hardly a growth business. As the talks with Iger progressed, Lachlan’s opposition hardened. “Why the [expletive] would I want to run this company?” he told people close to him. Lachlan’s anger at his father boiled over during a dinner in Manhattan in the fall of 2017, three people who were familiar with the incident told us. “If you take one more call on this deal, you will not have a son!” he threatened. “I will never talk to you again.” (Representatives for Murdoch and Lachlan denied that he made these threats.)
Over the course of our reporting, we spoke to a dozen people with direct knowledge of the Disney negotiations. What emerged were two diametrically different narratives of how the next act in the history of the Murdoch dynasty unfolded. Those closer to James say that Lachlan saw his birthright slipping away and tried to undermine the deal, even encouraging a rival bid from a different company that wouldn’t buy as many of 21st Century Fox’s assets. Those closer to Lachlan say that James was pushing the deal forward to advance his own career ambitions and was ready to settle for less than they could get for their father’s life’s work. Lachlan’s perception was affirmed, they said, when his father told him that he had received a call from a banker on the deal, reporting that James was trying to make his future at Disney part of the negotiations. Murdoch personally assured Iger that it wasn’t. (People closer to James say that there was no attempt to make the deal contingent on his role at Disney and that his primary concern was reaching the best agreement for the family and the shareholders.)
The family’s dysfunctional dynamics were readily apparent to Iger. Seeing James as a strong champion of the deal, he kept him close during the negotiations but never committed to offering him a specific, high-level position; publicly, he said only that he was considering the issue.
Negotiations nearly fell apart in October, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, when Murdoch called Iger to say that Disney’s valuation of the company was “inadequate” and that talks should “cease.” But they kept talking, meeting in London — Iger had come for the premiere of Disney’s “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” — to iron out more details. On Dec. 13, 2017, they announced an initial deal valued at $52.4 billion.
Accompanying the announcement was a photograph of Iger and Murdoch, their arms placed awkwardly on each other’s shoulders, standing on the rooftop of a London building, St. Paul’s Cathedral looming in the background. It was a peculiar image: the mogul who built the country’s most polarizing, rage-stoking political brand beside the one who presided over a media conglomerate whose very name was synonymous with equanimity and uplift. Inside the Murdoch empire, the incompatibility of Fox News and 21st Century Fox had long been a source of private complaint and ironic humor: “The Simpsons,” a Fox show, once parodied Fox News with a rolling news ticker featuring headlines like “Do Democrats Cause Cancer?” and “Study: 92 Percent of Democrats Are Gay.” Showrunners on the West Coast would press the Murdochs to get the network under control when a Fox News host would say something they considered offensive, for instance during the network’s coverage of the Charlottesville rally. But for many 21st Century Fox executives, the offenses had become a nightly occurrence during the Trump era, as the network’s opinion hosts fueled white resentment and anti-immigrant furor. Now, 21st Century Fox would be merged into a company that famously and assiduously avoided politics.
As for Fox News, the network would have one fewer corporate impediment preventing it from giving its viewers what they wanted.

The new humor-themed issue of The New York Times for Kids features writing on the science and philosophy of comedy — plus so many flatulence jokes they required their own page.
By Ed Winstead
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
“Fart” is not a word you see very often in The New York Times. In fact, for most of the paper’s history you never saw it at all — not because fart wasn’t in regular use (it has been since at least half a millennium before The Times existed), but rather because of its crudeness. It wasn’t until 1972 that it made its first appearance, in an extended quotation in an article about the writer Samuel Beckett. For the first story to feature farts, it had the perfect title: “As Close to Silence as a Man Can Get.”
Readers of the latest New York Times for Kids, which is published the last Sunday of each month, will learn very quickly how much can change in 47 years. This issue of the paper within the paper is dedicated to comedy, and covers everything from puns and dad jokes to politics and pranks. Naturally, there are farts. So many, in fact, that they have their own section. 
“We had too many good stories from writers about farts,” the NYT Kids editor, Amber Williams, said. “So we needed a farts page.” And there it is, right between “National” and “Science.”
“We already use humor,” Ms. Williams said, but this issue in particular allowed NYT Kids “to really push our stories, our style, our art as far as it could go.” And it’s not all hot air; the issue also features discussions of the science and philosophy of comedy, along with games, quizzes and more. John Schwartz, who covers climate change for The Times, wrote about his propensity for groan-worthy dad jokes. Nicholas St. Fleur, a science reporter, examined the bodily practicalities of astronauts’ lives in space.  
NYT Kids is a print-only section produced monthly by NYT Mag Labs, and takes the form of a mini-version of the paper itself, covering national and international news, science, culture, sports and more. But there are also occasional special issues — there will be four this year, beginning with the humor issue — that are themed.
It is important in every issue of NYT Kids, and particularly in a special issue like this, to “package it in a way that doesn’t talk down to kids,” said Debra Bishop, the art director of The New York Times Magazine Labs, who oversees the design of the mini-paper. “You want it to be cool, but you want it to also be very smart.” It is, she said, “beautifully designed within the genre. With a little bit of vulgarity in there, which I hope people aren’t too upset about.”
“The whole thing is pretty devious,” Ms. Williams said, though there’s “nothing inappropriate.” Still, her primary concern isn’t annoying adults by providing children with a treasure trove of pranks and jokes (though both she and Ms. Bishop joked about whether this issue, with all its pranks and scatological humor, might get them into trouble). Rather, her motivation is to stay true to her audience. 
“There’s tons of poking fun at grown-ups in this issue, and us siding with our readers,” Ms. Williams said — its contents include a how-to guide for making fun of your parents. “Even if adults are like, oh no, I don’t like being roasted, we don’t care. Because that’s what our readers want.”
Even so, the issue has plenty to offer older readers, too. Ms. Bishop pulled a scatological prank on her co-workers, though it didn’t quite work out. She swiped a couple of deceptively shaped chocolate-peanut-butter swirls (check out the section’s Food page to see exactly what shape) from a photo shoot late one afternoon. She left one on a colleague’s chair — but in the morning it was gone.
Nobody ever mentioned the chocolate surprise; and someone, somewhere, must be very confused. But Ms. Bishop stands by NYT Kids’ content. “I hope people actually make the chocolate-peanut-butter swirls,” Ms. Bishop said. “They taste pretty good.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — Harvard is investigating its longtime fencing coach after learning that he sold his house for a vastly inflated price to the father of a current student, shortly before the student was admitted.
The inquiry into the coach, Peter Brand, comes as universities around the country are scrambling to respond to a sweeping investigation of college admissions fraud, which has raised questions about athletic recruitment and whether coaches have enriched themselves by essentially selling recruiting slots.
The United States attorney’s office in Boston has charged 50 people in the case, including eight coaches and 33 parents, among them Hollywood celebrities and prominent business people.
Harvard has so far not been tied to the scandal in court documents. A university official said in an email to students and faculty members on Thursday that she did not believe the circumstances surrounding Mr. Brand, first reported by The Boston Globe, were connected to that case.
In 2016, Mr. Brand sold his house in Needham, a suburb of Boston, to Jie Zhao, whom The Globe described as a wealthy Maryland businessman. At the time, Mr. Zhao’s older son was a student at Harvard and on the fencing team, and his younger son was still in high school. Mr. Zhao paid $989,500, some $400,000 more than the assessed value at the time, which was $549,300.
“Place is vintage 1960s in bad shape,” the town’s assessor wrote when he inspected the house after the sale. “Makes no sense.”
At around the same time, Mr. Brand and his wife, Jacqueline Phillips, bought a condominium in Cambridge for $1.3 million, well above the $989,000 asking price.
Soon after, Mr. Zhao’s younger son, Edward, was admitted to Harvard, where he is currently a sophomore and at least until recently was on the fencing team, according to a profile that was recently deleted from the website for Harvard’s sports teams. He is no longer listed as a member of the team.
Mr. Zhao sold the house in Needham in October 2017, for $665,000, a significant loss.
Mr. Brand, Mr. Zhao, and Mr. Zhao’s sons did not respond to messages.
A spokeswoman for Harvard, Rachael Dane, said that the university was unaware of the circumstances surrounding the sale until asked about it by The Globe, and that it was now conducting an independent review.
“We are committed to ensuring the integrity of our recruitment practices,” she said.
Ms. Dane would not confirm whether Mr. Zhao’s younger son was in fact recruited by Mr. Brand, although the brothers were referred to as student-athletes in the email sent to students and faculty members on Thursday.
In the email, Claudine Gay, the dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, wrote that Harvard’s athletic recruitment practices were different from those of some other schools. The applications of student recruits are reviewed by the full admissions committee, which has roughly 40 members, and admissions decisions are made by a vote of the whole committee. Also, she said, all recruited athletes had to be interviewed by an admissions officer or alumni interviewer.
At this stage of the investigation into Mr. Brand, she said, there was a lot the university did not know yet.
“Regardless of what we eventually learn about these allegations, this is not a time for complacency,” she wrote. “Where there are opportunities to clarify practices and strengthen procedures, we must act on them, and do so with a sense of urgency.”
The university’s admissions practices have been under scrutiny for months. A lawsuit charging Harvard with discriminating against Asian-American applicants went to trial in October. In the process of defending itself, Harvard was forced to reveal many admissions secrets, including the advantages given to students whose parents went to Harvard, relatives of donors and recruited athletes. Documents showed that in recent years the admission rate of recruited athletes was 86 percent. A judge has not yet ruled in the lawsuit.
The Globe also reported on another set of peculiar transactions involving Mr. Brand, Mr. Zhao, and a nonprofit organization called the National Fencing Foundation of Washington D.C.
In 2013, Mr. Zhao made a $1 million gift to the fencing foundation, according to Timothy Miller, who was the organization’s treasurer at the time. The next year — the same year that Mr. Zhao’s older son, Eric, enrolled at Harvard — the fencing foundation made a $100,000 grant to a private foundation set up by Mr. Brand and his wife, tax documents show. The grant was one of only two that Mr. Brand’s foundation received before it dissolved two years later.
The fencing foundation’s president, Alexandre Ryjik, did not respond to messages.

LONDON — The Saatchi Gallery, Britain’s best-known and most popular private museum of cutting-edge contemporary art, is now operating as a nonprofit after a downturn in business and a decline in visitor numbers.
Since 1985, the gallery has been a platform for Britain’s most prominent and influential art collector, Charles Saatchi, to exhibit and promote works from his own collection. It was run as a commercial enterprise until last month. But Mr. Saatchi now appears to be relinquishing control of the institution, which has recently changed tack to display more art from outside his own holdings.
Last month, a new enterprise, also called the Saatchi Gallery, was registered as a charitable incorporated organization with the British government’s Charity Commission. Johan Eliasch, 57, a London-based Swedish billionaire who in the late 1990s turned around the fortunes of the ailing sports group Head N.V., was named as the lead trustee. Mr. Eliasch is a friend of Mr. Saatchi’s and a prominent environmental campaigner. He declined to comment.
Introduced by the British government in 2013, charitable incorporated organizations are meant to combine the benefits of being a nonprofit with those of being a company. The status gives a variety of tax reliefs and trustees “have limited or no liability for a charitable company’s debts,” according to the government’s website.
In recent years, the gallery’s finances have been controlled by one of Mr. Saatchi’s private companies.
Philippa Adams, the gallery’s director, said in an email that its operations “are continuing as before under the recently formed charity structure.” She added that the new charity was “debt free” and that all the gallery’s staff members had been transferred to it.
Mr. Saatchi, 75, is a former British advertising mogul who became one of the contemporary art world’s most influential and astute collectors and dealers. A 1997 exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, “Sensation: Young British Artists From the Saatchi Collection,” showcased a provocative new spirit in British art. Signature acquisitions, such as Damien Hirst’s 1991 shark-in-formaldehyde sculpture, “The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living,” and Tracey Emin’s 1998 installation, “My Bed,” were later sold for millions.
The Saatchi Gallery, which for the past 10 years has leased the stately Duke of York’s Headquarters building in the Chelsea district of London, has concentrated on showing new works by emerging artists from Mr. Saatchi’s collection “to the widest audience possible,” according to the gallery’s website. Free admission to the gallery’s own shows encouraged high attendance figures. Just over 1.8 million visited the museum in 2017, but last year that figure declined by a third to 1.2 million, according to annual reports of museum attendances published by The Art Newspaper.
Guest exhibitions with ticket sales and renting out the venue for events have become the gallery’s main sources of revenue. Some critics have said that commercial exhibitions, such as a two-day pop-up “immersive experience” in 2017 to celebrate 10 years of the reality TV show “Keeping Up With the Kardashians,” or the coming “Tutankhamun: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh” blockbuster, a global touring show produced by the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities and the IMG Group (where Mr. Eliasch has been a director), have blunted the gallery’s cutting-edge brand.
“The astonishment of the early Saatchi has now been normalized,” said Stephen Bayley, a cultural commentator and former director of the privately owned Design Museum in London. “The artists he showcased who caused outrage 30-plus years ago have become media-friendly house-trained pop celebrities,” he added. “And the Saatchi Gallery is on its way to becoming an event venue.”
Accounts submitted to Companies House, Britain’s national business registry, by Marchill Investments, the entity Mr. Saatchi has used to run the gallery, show that in 2017 the company had a loss of £24,764, or about $32,600, compared with a profit of £1.2 million in 2016. Corporate sponsorship in 2017 was down 37 percent year-on-year to £2.2 million. Marchill Investments’ accounts for 2018 were overdue, according to the Companies House website.
Mr. Saatchi, who declined to comment for this article, announced in 2010 that he wished to donate his collection (then valued at $37 million) to the nation on his retirement. This proposed gift has never been formally accepted by the British government and Mr. Saatchi has yet to formally announce that he is stepping back from public life.

MINNEAPOLIS — The losses last weekend by Duke, Gonzaga, Kentucky and Purdue pulled the curtains on their seasons, one painful game short of the Final Four.
 Those teams that made it to Minneapolis ? The guys from Michigan State, Texas Tech, Auburn and Virginia will be greeted, literally, by giant drapes inside the building where the 2019 champion will be determined.
Yes, the bigger and fancier the site, the more complicated the conversion. From the extra speakers to the special center-hung scoreboard to the temporary blinds at U.S. Bank Stadium, turning a football-sized venue into a basketball-friendly facility has become quite the project.
That's fitting, of course, because the Final Four has become quite the event.
"People have said, 'It's a game for an arena,' but trying to go back at this point on the opportunities? Instead of giving approximately 5,000 tickets to each school, they'd be receiving far less than that, and then you've got all of the membership, the other schools that want access and the general public," said L.J. Wright, the NCAA's director of men's basketball championships. "The demand is still here, and so we want to expose and help grow the game through that exposure."
When the NCAA first began using an "in-the-round" seating configuration at Ford Field in Detroit in 2009, where the court is placed on the middle of the turf instead of in one of the corners and the entire bowl is used, the minimum-capacity requirement for a Final Four was raised to 60,000 seats.
That whittled the candidate pool to the 10 climate-controlled NFL-level venues, which had been sprinkled into the rotation throughout the 1980s and 1990s until the last NBA-sized host was used in East Rutherford, New Jersey, in 1996. There are currently only 10 covered stadiums big enough in the entire country to bid.
Nestled into a compact downtown, filled with state-of-the-art amenities and fresh from holding the Super Bowl 14 months ago, U.S. Bank Stadium fits the bill. The not-quite-3-year-old facility's defining feature, though, created an additional challenge for the host. The skyline-facing front of the building is essentially one big picture window, including five of the world's largest pivoting glass doors ranging from 75 to 95 feet high. Then there is the roof, about 60% of which is composed of a lightweight translucent plastic called ETFE .
Even on some of the coldest afternoons, like the 2-degree outside temperature at kickoff of the Super Bowl, enough sunlight can stream in to make a television viewer do a double-take and wonder for a second if the game is actually being played in Arizona or Florida.
"That's what makes this building unique. That's what makes it beautiful. That's what really makes it the gold standard in the NFL. Unfortunately, that is also what makes it very complex for us," said Patrick Talty, the general manager for stadium operator SMG. "Because of that competitive nature, needing the light to be the same for all teams in all situations, we then have to take our biggest asset away."
To keep the glare off the TV cameras and out of the eyes of the free-throw shooters, a darkening plan is mandated for each bidding venue. There is no issue for many of them, but at U.S. Bank Stadium, this sleek, steep and ship-shaped $1.1 billion home of the Minnesota Vikings, there is 460,000 square feet to cover.
The $4.6 million project, covered by the building's capital improvement fund, was so big the Minnesota Sports Facilities Authority split it between two manufacturers: theater-style curtains for the front and sailboat-like textile for the roof . Just one of the custom-made ceiling darkening panels is 10 feet wide and up to 370 feet long. The setup took five to seven days for 20 to 25 workers, with a similar timeframe for teardown.
The cost of the blinds and the altering of the building's identity have prompted some complaints from the public, but the blinds will be reused for concerts and conventions and are expected to last for the life of the stadium, MSFA chairman Michael Vekich said.
For now, the fabric will help transform the colossal structure into an environment as close to an on-campus arena as possible, if that's possible for an event that has averaged about 72,800 fans in attendance over the last 10 years. Putting 600 students from each school in $40 floor seats behind each basket was one way the NCAA has tried to increase the energy, along with subtly amplified noise for seats that are the farthest from the court so the swishes, clangs and squeaks can still be audible.
"Final Fours in the past used to be a little stagnant because you'd get people who sit on their hands who aren't as energetic," Wright said. "When you think of college basketball, you think of students on their feet and jumping. They're involved. They're a part of the event, so that's been a special thing."

MINNEAPOLIS — Duke freshman Zion Williamson won the Oscar Robertson Trophy, presented to the 2018-19 U.S. Basketball Writers Association player of the year.
Williamson is the eighth Blue Devil to win the trophy and the third freshman (Kentucky's Anthony Davis, Texas' Kevin Durant) to claim the honor.
Robertson presented Williamson the bronze trophy, which portrays Robertson's likeness, Friday at U.S. Bank Stadium in a press conference with Joe Mitch of the USBWA. Williamson was also presented with the AP national player of the year in another ceremony after receiving 59 of a possible 64 first-place votes.
"There are so many other great players across the country that could have won this award," Williamson said. "This award, I see it as a team award. Without them I wouldn't be here. I would really like to thank my mom for pushing me after every practice, every game."
Robertson said Williamson's footwork caught his attention watching him play this season.
Williamson, who was also a unanimous selection to the 2019 college basketball All-America team on Tuesday, averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.8 blocks per game.
"Talking to Zion in the back, I congratulated him for having such a great year," Robertson said. "But your best basketball is all in front of you. It's just exciting for me to sit beside you. You are so humble about the award and this is great. ... I hope you go to the right team. You're going to be a tremendous star in the NBA."
Williamson is projected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. He laughed off suggestions that he wouldn't play for certain NBA teams after an April 1 report from ESPN hinted he wouldn't play for the Knicks.
Williamson said he plans to enjoy college and will discuss his next step with his family.
Williamson is the seventh Duke player to win AP player of the year honors. He is the third freshman to claim the AP award, with Davis and Durant again being the other two.

Denny Hamlin has won twice in seven Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races this season and is second in the standings heading into Sunday's Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway.
Despite a stellar a start to the season, Hamlin prefers not to rejoice over what his Joe Gibbs Racing No. 11 Toyota team has accomplished. Hamlin prefers to look ahead, adamant that he and his team can -- and will -- be even better as the season progresses.
Hamlin's belief is supported by the fact that while he has two wins -- the season-opening Daytona 500 and last week's race at Texas Motor Speedway -- he and his No. 11 team have actually been quite mistake-prone.
The team has been penalized four times in the past three races for rules infractions on pit road -- two for Hamlin speeding, and two for the pit crew having an uncontrolled tire. Last week, Hamlin had to twice rally back from penalties to win at Texas.
Nonetheless, Hamlin's two wins are tied for most in the series and he has finished in the top 10 in every race but one. He trails JGR teammate Kyle Busch, who has also won twice this season, by a mere eight points in the standings.
"I'm confident that if we can still have those kind of results with those kind of shortfalls, that we're a team that can battle back, and once we do have clean races, we're going to have dominant races," Hamlin said. .".. I just feel like we're definitely going to be better a few months from now than what we are now."
Cleaning up penalties isn't the only reason why Hamlin says the No. 11 team will be better in the future. Hamlin is in his first season working with crew chief Chris Gabehart, a first-year crew chief in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series.
Based off the results, Hamlin and Gabehart have clicked well enough that Hamlin is off to the best start of his 14-year career. But that all-important chemistry between driver and crew chief, so often the difference from a team being very good and being excellent, is still developing, Hamlin said.
He credits Gabehart for helping him evolve as a driver by bringing a different approach than what he's accustomed to, coinciding with NASCAR implementing a new aerodynamic rules package this season that has required further adjustments.
Ultimately, Hamlin wants to replicate the kind of relationship that Busch has with his crew chief, Adam Stevens. That will take time, although it is not lost on Hamlin that Busch and Stevens won the 2015 Cup championship in their first season together.
"I just feel confident in that, and knowing that certainly with a little bit more execution and more learning with me and Chris we've continued to get better and better every race track we've gone to," Hamlin said. "We're really learning each other more and more.
"I feel like we're not even close to the level of relationship that like Kyle and Adam are at; that's where obviously you want to go with it. We're miles apart from them as far as that aspect, but we're not miles apart as far as how we're running right now."

PARIS — Olympique de Marseille's hopes of playing in next season's Champions League took a major knock when their top-flight winless streak at Girondins Bordeaux continued in a 2-0 defeat on Friday.
OM, who have not won at Bordeaux in the elite since 1977, lie fifth in the Ligue 1 standings on 48 points from 31 games, eight behind third-placed Olympique Lyonnais who have a match in hand.
Bordeaux are 11th on 38 points.
Bordeaux, who finished with 10 men after defender Pablo was sent off in the 82nd, went ahead in the 27th minute when Francois Kamano converted a penalty following a handball by Nemanja Radonjic.
Nicolas de Preville then beat defenders Boubacar Kamara and Hiroki Sakai before firing past Steve Mandanda to make it 2-0 after 71 minutes.
Marseille were without the injured Lucas Ocampos while Mario Balotelli started on the bench. He replaced Dimitri Payet in the 68th minute but was toothless like the rest of a disappointing OM side.
Lyon, who hold the last Champions League qualifying spot, host Dijon on Saturday.
Leaders Paris St Germain will claim the title if they beat Strasbourg on Sunday and Lille fail to take all three points at Stade de Reims earlier in the day.

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Women will have their day at Augusta National on Saturday when the golf club, once ground zero in the gender equality battle, hosts the final round of the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA).
The word historic has been attached to the first ever competitive women's round at the home of the Masters and the occasion will be given the full treatment, with NBC providing live coverage and Augusta National rolling out the pomp, ceremony and tradition that is its trademark.
The image of 30 women competing at a club which only seven years ago did not have a single female member is being held up as another small victory for equality.
Martha Burk, who put Augusta National's all-male membership policy under a microscope, will not be celebrating mocking the ANWA as a public relations stunt but the 77-year-old activist says she and her group of protesters will take credit for sparking the little progress that has been made.
"I just don't have any doubt about that at all if no public pressure or international spotlight had been shined on it thanks to us they would still be doing the same thing and getting away with it," Burk told Reuters. "I'm sorry I'm just not buying it. 
"People are going to say it is just sour grapes because she did not succeed in her crusade back in 2003 but I think what progress we are seeing is a direct result of what we did."
What Burk did 16 years ago was put unwanted scrutiny on Augusta National Golf Club and its gender discrimination policy.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became a sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and for decades remained unmoved by outside forces and events.
It would be nearly 80 years until Augusta National relented in 2012, with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore becoming the first women to don the iconic Green Jackets that distinguish members and Masters champions.
Holding up Augusta National as a relic of the past, the National Council of Women's Organisations spearheaded by Burk took their fight to the club's doorstep during 2003 Masters week, drawing the attention of the world's media.
Augusta National could not stop the protest but was able to keep it well away from the club's doorstep, a court order restricting the event to a muddy field out of view of patrons and sponsors.
The protest failed to draw the numbers it hoped for, collapsing into a near farce with clowns and an Elvis impersonator getting as much attention as Burk herself.
While the mood was light, the seriousness of the issue was underscored by Burk having to demonstrate wearing a bullet proof vest while the FBI tapped her phone chasing down death threats.
"If social media had been around I would be dead," Burk said. "I got so many death threats over Augusta, that day I was wearing a bullet proof vest and I had hired body guards because people were just rampant about it and I really do believe if social media had existed somebody would have tracked me down and shot me."
ABSOLUTE SECRECY
One of the world's most exclusive clubs, Augusta National operates in absolute secrecy. Even the smallest detail such as who dry cleans the Green Jackets is classified.
The club's most heavily guarded secret, however, is its membership and when Burk was leaked a list of the 300 Green Jackets her group mounted a campaign urging consumers to boycott Masters sponsors.
Her organisation also facilitated two sex discrimination lawsuits against Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley, whose CEOs were Augusta members, and collected $79 million in settlements. 
It was that legal action, Burk believes, that produced the first cracks in Augusta National's resolve.
"I did not feel particularly defeated," said Burk, reflecting on her 2003 protest. "I know people expected me to go crawl into a hole and never come out because we weren't successful but we just kept trucking along.
"We had a list of all the members and the companies they were affiliated with and I think the club knew that they weren't going to be the last two lawsuits.
"I knew you could not put that genie back in the bottle it was going to come up as it has every year. 
"I knew that eventually something would come of it.
"Will they ever be true converts as opposed to Easter Sunday Christians? I don't know but at least they are making the right noises. 
"It is never going to go away for them."

MINNEAPOLIS — Virginia junior guard Kyle Guy is comfortable shooting in the driveway or the gym. He got up shots at Harlem's Rucker Park and now can say he's splashed a few in a football stadium, too.
"As a shooter, obviously, you have to be confident in yourself, and your teammates have to be confident in you, and with that confidence, it doesn't matter where you're shooting," said Guy, who put up 25 points and made five huge 3-pointers to keep Virginia in the West Region final against Purdue. "You could be shooting at Rucker Park in Harlem, or you could be shooting in a football stadium. You just have to have confidence. Obviously, it's very nice that we get to practice here twice, so we can kind of get a feel for it. But when the ball is tipped, it doesn't matter what the backdrop is. It's just we prepared for this, and we're going to be ready."
The Cavaliers, the only No. 1 seed to survive and reach Minneapolis, were the second team on the practice court Friday, following Auburn. Neither team looked to be bothered by the massive arena during open practice sessions at U.S. Bank Stadium.
Virginia took a team trip to Rucker Park -- the famous outdoor court across from the old Polo Grounds at 155th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard in the Harlem neighborhood recently revisited in the Kyrie Irving flick "Uncle Drew" -- while in New York last season. Guy, a 21-year-old from Indianapolis who picked Virginia over Cal and Indiana, is also preparing for another big day off the court. He and his bride to be became a topic of conversation Thursday, when Guy said he was told he couldn't register for his upcoming wedding by the NCAA.
NCAA president Mark Emmert said the story was not accurate. On Friday, the NCAA further clarified that Guy can, in fact, have a wedding registry but fans are not allowed to send him gifts. Longtime girlfriend Alexa Jenkins and Guy will restore their registry after the Final Four.
To extend their trip to Monday night, the Cavaliers are counting on Guy to deliver big in the national semifinal matchup with Auburn.
"I've done a really good job this year of never hanging my head whenever I'm hitting or missing," Guy said. "To see them go down was good."
Head coach Tony Bennett said one of the keys for Virginia against Auburn will be defending the Tigers' 3-point barrage. Virginia (28.7 percent) is among the best in the nation defending the 3, but Auburn averages 30.1 attempts per game.
"We just have to get to the shooters," Virginia sophomore De'Andre Hunter said. "We practice it every day. We have to get to them quick, possibly run them off their line and make them make plays. It's going to be a collective defensive effort."

LONDON — E-bikes are already a divisive topic in cycling clubs around the world and many a Sunday morning warrior has cursed at the sight of one gliding effortlessly past on a lung-burning climb.
Now cycling's governing body the UCI and its motorcycling counterpart have become embroiled in a row over which organization holds jurisdiction over E-bike competitions.
The huge rise in popularity of pedal bicycles with small motors, especially E-mountain bikes, led to the UCI integrating them into its competition regulations in January.
The first UCI E-Mountain Bike World Championships will be held in Canada later this tear while several E-bike events have been registered on the UCI's 2019 mountain bike calendar.
However, the Federation of International Motocycling (FIM) potentially threw a spanner in the works by last month announcing a rival series, the inaugural FIM E-Bike Enduro World Cup that will take place in France in June.
In a statement on Friday the UCI said it was "surprised and disappointed" by the move, insisting E-bikes are one of the disciplines under its auspices, along with road, track and BMX.
"The UCI had already notified the FIM in September 2017 that it considered E-mountain bike events to come exclusively under its jurisdiction and that the respective roles of the two International Federations (UCI and FIM) were clear and would not be called into question," it said.
Riders who take part in FIM-organized events could face disciplinary measures, the UCI said.
"The UCI means to develop this activity which, as with other forms of cycling, comes under its exclusive jurisdiction," UCI president David Lappartient said.
The UCI has strict regulations regarding the electric motors on E-mountain bikes which must not exceed 250 watts. Pedaling assistance is only permitted to a maximum speed of 25kph.
FIM's Enduro 1 events allow motors to produce more than 250 watts with pedaling assistance allowed up to 45kph.
Julien Absalon, five-times world mountain bike champion and twice Olympic gold medalist, is a convert to E-bikes, winning the French national championships.
"Electrically-assisted mountain bike is a new challenge for me," he said. "I won the first French Championships and I cannot wait for the UCI World Championships in Mont-Saint-Anne.
"It's good that bodies such as the UCI take new practices seriously. The manufacturers, athletes, and public are there. The electric bike is a social phenomenon that contributes to the development of our sport. It is great that it is also recognized at the highest level."

MILAN — Serie A's disciplinary tribunal has postponed a decision on the alleged racist insults aimed at Juventus forward Moise Kean during a match at Cagliari and fined the player for diving in the same game.
Cagliari supporters made the noise which is described in Italy as “buu” and is regarded as a racist insult after Kean, who had been jeered throughout the game, stood in front of them and opened his arms after scoring in Juve's 2-0 win.
The 85th-minute incident provoked an angry protest from Kean's team mate, French midfielder Blaise Matuidi, who complained he was subject to racist abuse at Cagliari last season.
The tribunal said on Friday that it had asked for more information from the match delegates and public authorities "to establish in which phases of the match (Matuidi and Kean) were the target of chanting which could be considered racial discrimination."
It also needed to determine "the real dimension and perception" of the alleged racist abuse, the tribunal said in a statement.
Separately, the tribunal fined the 19-year-old Kean 2,000 euros (1,718.53 pounds) for diving in the penalty area in the first half, for which he received a yellow card. Napoli forward Arkadiusz Milik was fined the same amount for diving in his team's match against Empoli.
Earlier this season, Inter Milan were ordered two play two home matches behind closed doors after Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was racially abused in a match at San Siro.

On the day after February’s trade deadline stripped the Rangers of three key veterans, David Quinn’s whistle pierced the practice rink air. The coach barked with the rasp of a well-worn instructor’s voice, “That can’t happen.” The Rangers reran the drill, which Quinn this time punctuated with “good job.”
An hour into the session, Quinn skated in to speak quietly with Brendan Lemieux during a defensive routine. Lemieux, the 23-year-old prospect acquired in a trade for Kevin Hayes, had met Quinn only that morning after joining from the Winnipeg Jets.
“That’s what was really cool about my first practice,” Lemieux said afterward. “I was already learning things, being taught. I guess that goes to what kind of coach he is. He’s a teacher. There are a lot of N.H.L. coaches that aren’t like that.”
With the Rangers more than a year into a rebuild, teaching a young team has been Quinn’s primary objective. Ten players on the Rangers’ roster are 23 or younger. Entering the final game of the season, the Rangers have just four wins in 19 games since the trade deadline on Feb. 25, though seven losses were by a single goal, including five in overtime or a shootout.
“We were close, but that doesn’t cut it in this league,” Quinn said.
He arrived in New York last May after five years as the head coach at Boston University and more than two decades leading or assisting predominantly A.H.L., college and national team development programs. Quinn’s own promising playing career came to an abrupt end in college with the diagnosis of hemophilia and a life-threatening injury.
“When you look at what he’s gone through as a coach in order to reach the pinnacle of the game, not a lot of people would go through what Quinny has gone through,” said Penguins Coach Mike Sullivan, a former teammate at B.U. “I think that’s a reflection of his love of the sport but also his competitive nature.”
General Manager Jeff Gorton called Quinn’s track record with young players a huge part of his appeal. That recent history included work with four first-round picks while leading B.U., a group headlined by the Buffalo Sabres star Jack Eichel. Quinn, 52, had taken over for the longtime coach Jack Parker — for whom Quinn played in the 1980s — and he expected to spend his career there even as three N.H.L. teams called to gauge his interest.
But, Quinn said, “It’s the New York Rangers.”
“I really don’t think I ever would have left B.U. for any other situation, or people, or organization than this,” he added. “Everything aligned. Every single thing.”
Quinn has so often preached his desire that the Rangers play “fast, physical, and relentless” hockey that some players refer to the phrase as “our team slogan.” His first season was notable for its hard practices, blunt postgame assessments and healthy scratches. Quinn’s players, past and present, consistently mention his honest and direct style of giving feedback.
“He’s very good at communicating, but he’s so smart about the way he does it, too,” Eichel said.
Sabres forward Evan Rodrigues, who played his junior and senior seasons at B.U. under Quinn, had a goal and an assist in his first game for Quinn in October 2013. Afterward, Quinn asked the player for a self-evaluation. Rodrigues said, “Probably like a B, B+.” Quinn replied, “Well, I give you a C-.”
In hindsight, Rodrigues realized his coach was right.
“I don’t doubt much that he says,” Rodrigues said, before adding: “I’m very, very thankful for him because I don’t think I’d be where I am today if it weren’t for him.”
Quinn attributed that plain-spoken manner partly to his father — “an old-school Irish cop” — and to his sudden diagnosis as a college sophomore with hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease.
“Life experiences form all of us,” he said. “I think that is probably why I’m so direct with people because of what I’ve been through personally. I really believe those experiences — because I really struggled for two years after that. Then I got back on my feet and went, ‘All right, hey, look how lucky I am, really.’”
After Quinn dealt with persistent bruising throughout the 1985-86 season, B.U.’s team physician suggested he get blood work after the playoffs. The tests showed hemophilia.
“I’m 20 years old and I think I’m going to play in the N.H.L. and I think I’m going to play for the ’88 Olympic team,” Quinn said. “You’re talking about a big kick in the teeth, you know? I’m trying to scramble. What am I going to do with my life? I had my next 15 years mapped out. I was a first-round pick, I’m going to play in the N.H.L. And I went through some tough times, but I always thought to myself, ‘The people who really have affected me in my life other than my parents are my coaches.’”
Quinn continued playing for B.U., but, after an injury-plagued junior season, he badly sprained his right ankle playing pickup basketball. The bruising turned into compartment syndrome, which required surgery. In his Rangers office recently, he rolled down a red-and-blue striped sock to expose a scar running down the outer half of his calf muscle to his ankle.
He was in the hospital for five weeks and said he almost bled to death. His collegiate hockey career was over. Quinn remained at B.U. to finish his sociology degree and helped coach the school’s junior varsity hockey team.
In 1991, the F.D.A. approved a drug trial to help hemophiliacs clot more quickly. By injecting himself before every practice and game, Quinn returned to the ice in what he refers to only as a “pseudo-comeback.” He had not skated in four years and had lost some mobility in his right foot.
Quinn signed with the Rangers in 1992 and played a year and a half of minor league hockey. He had been a lock for the 1988 Olympic team but was a late cut from the ’92 squad. He tried out one final time for the 1994 roster, but was cut early.
The night he was cut, Quinn was in his family’s home in Cranston, R.I., when his former B.U. assistant coach Ben Smith called. Smith had taken over as Northeastern head coach and offered Quinn an assistant job. He drove to Boston the next day.
Quinn spent two nomadic decades in the coaching ranks. He was associate coach of B.U.’s 2009 N.C.A.A. championship team and was head coach of the 2015 squad that lost in the national title game. He was known for his recruiting panache.
“I remember my mom couldn’t stop talking about him,” said Rangers defenseman Kevin Shattenkirk, who was recruited to B.U. by Quinn. “He put the charm on my mom. I think, more than anything, he just had this presence to him.”
Now, Quinn is charged with coaxing the most out of the Rangers’ young talent.
“They’re a structured team,” said Florida Panthers associate coach Jack Capuano, a lifelong friend of Quinn’s. “They work hard. Obviously they’re buying into what he’s selling.”
Quinn said the Rangers had “some good pieces here to build around,” citing the advances the Islanders and the Canadiens have made since last season.
A talented new piece of the puzzle is likely on its way. The Rangers will participate in the N.H.L. draft lottery on Tuesday.
Quinn, who lamented the lack of practice time in the N.H.L., called the challenge of rebuilding through development “very appealing.”
“You really get a chance as the coach to be very involved in the process of the next great team here, hopefully,” he said.
An earlier version of this article misstated the number of overtime losses the Rangers had since the trade deadline on Feb. 25. It was five, not four.

(Reuters) - Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero will travel with the rest of their squad for their FA Cup semi-final against Brighton and Hove Albion having nearly recovered from a hamstring injury, manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday.
The Argentina international, who is the Premier League's top scorer with 19 goals, missed City's 2-0 victory over relegation-threatened Cardiff City on Wednesday and was a doubt for Saturday's semi-final at Wembley.
"Almost everybody is fit," Guardiola told a news conference. "Sergio Aguero is almost fit. He is travelling."
City are challenging on all fronts this season and could potentially win three more trophies before the campaign ends, having already lifted the League Cup.
The team are top of the league going into the weekend's games and have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League as well as the FA Cup semis and Guardiola believes they are poised to build a lasting legacy.
"We are still young in terms of a lot of titles but every season when you are able to win you become a better club, a better organisation, so that's the target," the Spaniard added.
"We can't deny the last decade in terms of English titles and being there in the Champions League, qualifying always, so it's really good. We came from nothing with that, now we have that, we'll see how far we're going to get."
Stand-in left back Oleksandr Zinchenko has a hamstring injury and Guardiola is ready to draft Benjamin Mendy, who has been recovering from a knee injury, into the side for the first time Jan. 23 as a result.
"Everybody has to help us, not just Mendy," the manager added.

(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.
England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.
Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.
Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game. 
"The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer," Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.
"I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday."
The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.

(Reuters) - Double Olympic champion James Cracknell is set to become the oldest person to compete in the Varsity boat race, with his Cambridge crew ranked as firm favorites to win the event on Sunday.
The 46-year-old retired from competitive rowing in 2006 but qualified for the event because he is studying a Master of Philosophy degree in human evolution at the University.
Cracknell, who won Olympic gold at Sydney in 2000 and Athens in 2004, would also become the most decorated man to row in the annual contest between Cambridge and Oxford.
British bookmaker William Hill said Cracknell's inclusion has steered Cambridge from 11/10 outsiders to firm favorites at 1/5. Oxford are 7/2 to win the race.
"We aren't sure whether it is the presence of James Cracknell in the Cambridge boat that has persuaded punters to part with their cash or the fact that people think they are much better," said William Hill spokesman Joe Crilly. 
"Regardless of the reason, 62 percent of all bets and 95 percent of all the money placed on the race has been for Cambridge."
Cambridge won all four races against Oxford last year, triumphing in the men's, women's and both reserve crew races at the event held on River Thames.

Clayton Kershaw was upbeat Thursday night despite producing a mediocre pitching line during a minor league rehab start.
The Los Angeles Dodgers ace, on the injured list due to left shoulder inflammation, tossed 4 1/3 innings while pitching for the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers. He allowed two runs on four hits, including a home run, and two walks while striking out six.
"I feel good," Kershaw said postgame. "It was a good first step. Got through everything I needed to, got up to that fifth inning, got some guys on base, worked out of the stretch, did multiple different things. So it was a good day."
Helped by a solo home run from Tyrone Taylor off Kershaw, the visiting San Antonio Missions spoiled Oklahoma City's season opener by emerging with a 5-3 win.
It is unclear if Kershaw's next start will be in the minors or if he will return to the Dodgers' major league rotation.

(Reuters) - When Liverpool cleared a corner and the ball arrived at Mohamed Salah's feet 20 yards inside his own half at Southampton on Friday there was just one thing on the Egyptian's mind.
A handful of seconds later, after a searing 50-metre run, his left-foot shot flew past Angus Gunn to give Liverpool the lead on a nailbiting night on the south coast.
Jordan Henderson scored another one to make it 3-1 and confirm Liverpool's place back on top of the Premier League, but the defining moment was Salah's drought-busting effort.
He had not scored for eight matches, his worst run at Liverpool, but his 80th-minute intervention could not have been better-timed. It was his 50th Premier League goal for Liverpool and, more importantly, proved that any concern over his form in the title run-in could be put to bed.
With five league games left Salah is undeniably back.
"What a goal! Wow, what a goal!" Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp, who hugged his striker on the pitch as Liverpool's fans roared out their song about the "Egyptian King".
Salah is the eighth Liverpool player to score 50 Premier League goals, but his half century arrived in only 69 games, three fewer than Fernando Torres, the previous quickest to the mark. 
Only two other players in the Premier League era have reached the landmark quicker -- Manchester United's Ruud van Nistelrooy and Alan Shearer for Blackburn Rovers.
Klopp told reporters he had never doubted Salah would rediscover his scoring touch.
"It was never in doubt about him being a great player from my side," Klopp said. "It was goal number 50 I heard for Liverpool, that's an incredible number," the German said.
"As a striker, you have chances and each striker is a human being -- maybe you have better moments and less good moments. But he is pretty consistent, his physical things are always there. He always stayed calm to deal with the situation."
Liverpool were not at their best, especially in a sluggish first half when they gave the ball away cheaply too often and Southampton threatened to add to their ninth-minute opener scored by Shane Long.
But once Naby Keita levelled with a deflected header in the 36th minute, his first goal for Liverpool, the visitors were relentless in their pursuit of a crucial win.
Klopp's side have now won seven of their last eight Premier League games when conceding the opening goal -- a resilience that will be causing concern at relentless Manchester City who now trail by two points having played a game less.
"The season is intense for everyone," Klopp said. "The performance was not top level but it is about fighting.
"People want us to play like Manchester City, we are unable to do that, we play our own football. We have 82 points now, that is massive in this crazy league and everyone is waiting for us. I am really proud. It is incredible.
"It is a difficult year for everybody, you need to have 70-75 points for the (top-four) Champions League and 90-something for the title.
"We are in the race and that is nice."

AUGUSTA, Georgia — A lot of fathers found themselves out of jobs on Friday as golfers playing in the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA) opted for club caddies over daddies for the final round.
After the opening two rounds of the 54-hole tournament staged at Champions Retreat in nearby Evans, awed young women, many with their equally-awed fathers on their bags, got first look at the revered layout that is home for the Masters, the year's first major.
But walking with their daughters in Friday's practice round is as close as some dad caddies will come to Augusta National with several deciding on a switch and handing their fathers pink slips.
While dads may know their daughters better than anyone, local caddies, some who have worked Augusta National for decades, know the course and particularly the baffling greens.
For some, including Jennifer Kupcho, who will take a one- shot lead over Mexico’s Maria Fassi into the final round, that kind of knowledge trumps family ties.
The world's top-ranked amateur, Kupcho's decision to go with a local caddie was an easy one, although the American laughed she had not yet broken the news to her father Michael. 
"I had my caddie there with me the first time I played so we had fun and he knows what he is doing," said Kupcho, who used the same caddie Brian Murphy when she played Augusta as a guest. "I think he's hired."
HISTORIC DAY
Instead of being part of an historic day on which the first competitive women's round will be played at Augusta National and a champion crowned, Michael Kupcho will watch from outside the ropes along with Kevin Harford, who was on his daughter Haylee's bag the first two rounds.
A tough choice, however, was made easier when Harford told his daughter the smart move might be to go with a local caddie.
"We came into the day kind of trying to figure it out and I was going to decide afterwards but I think I am going to go to a local caddie because they know so much," said Haylee, who sits at one-over, six off the pace.
"But my dad was able to kind of walk to get some notes and feel it out so we could make that decision.
"He's willing to do anything that makes me happy and is best for me so he kind of came to me on the second hole and said I don't know maybe you should take the caddie."
For Spain's Marta Perez, who describes herself as a golfer who plays with passion and emotion, having someone on her bag who can read her is more important than reading greens.
And in her case father Jose knows best.
"My dad, he is my coach, he started coaching me when I was eight years old so this is special for me," said Perez.
"We had a discussion if it was better to have a local caddie tomorrow but I want to stick with our plan I think it is great that he is here, he knows me more than anyone.
"I think it is special for him to be here with me because we are going to remember this forever."

Ally McDonald made a 5-foot birdie putt on the final stroke of the first round on Thursday to take the lead in the ANA Inspiration.
McDonald shot a four-under-par 68 at Mission Hills in Rancho Mirage, Calif., playing in the last group of the day off the first tee. The tree-lined course was made more difficult with thick rough, tighter fairways and some lengthened holes.
She birdied all four par-5 holes, the last in fading light on the water-guarded 18th.
“I just drove the ball really well,” McDonald said. “Gave myself a lot of opportunities to make good approach shots into the green.”
Only 28 of the 112 players broke par in the tournament, the first L.P.G.A. major championship of the year, with McDonald and the other afternoon starters facing gusts. She had a one-stroke lead over the 2014 champion, Lexi Thompson; Jin Young Ko; Hyo Joo Kim; and Linnea Strom. Thompson, Ko and Kim played in calmer morning conditions, but with the thick rough wet from dew.
McDonald, 26, played at Mississippi State after becoming the only female player to win the state boys’ high school championship. She had made only two previous starts this season, her third on the tour. She tied for 58th two weeks ago in Phoenix in the Founders Cup and missed the cut last week in Carlsbad.
“I think in this position that I’ve never been in, it’s so easy to get ahead of yourself,” McDonald said. “For me, I’m just going to take it easy. I know that on the very first day, a great round is awesome, but there is so much more golf left to play.”
McDonald birdied the last three holes on the front nine and added another on the par-5 11th. She gave back a stroke on the par-3 14th before pulling ahead on 18.
Strom, also playing in the afternoon, made a 25-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th, with the pin on the far right side, to reach four under. She then bogeyed the 18th after hitting her drive over the right-side cart path and under a tree. Strom was making her fifth start in her first season on the LPGA Tour.
“I know it’s a tough course, but there are some birdies out there,” said Strom, a former Arizona State player from Sweden.
Thompson birdied the final two holes, hitting to a foot on 18 after her caddie, Benji Thompson, talked her into a lower-lofted wedge.
“I wanted to hit my 50 degree, which was max what the yardage was,” Thompson said. “He was like, ‘No, just chip the 47, take the spin off, in case a gust does come up.’ Sure enough, it did. Just chipped up there. I was like, ‘Thank you so much, Benji.’ ”
Jessica Korda had seven birdies in an adventurous 70. She also had a double bogey after driving out of bounds on the par-4 third and three bogeys.
“A serious roller coaster,” Korda said. “Glad I got off it on 18.”
WOMEN’S PLAY AT AUGUSTA The N.C.A.A. champion Jennifer Kupcho held on for a one-under-par 71 for a one-shot lead over Maria Fassi of Mexico in the Augusta National Women’s Amateur, leaving her one round away from a chance to become the first woman to win a tournament at the home of the Masters.
TEXAS OPEN Si Woo Kim birdied five of his final eight holes for a six-under-par 66 and a one-shot first-round lead over four others in San Antonio. Ricky Fowler and Jordan Spieth were part of a group that was another shot back in the event, the last on the PGA Tour before the Masters.

MINNEAPOLIS — Texas Tech coach Chris Beard was named college basketball Coach of the Year on Thursday.
Texas Tech has a school-record 30 wins entering Saturday's national semi-final against Michigan State.
"I just want to thank the game of basketball for everything it does for people. It changes lives, and it's just a special thing. Especially college basketball. When executed correctly, it can just change lives," Beard said Thursday. "None of us are here today without basketball."
Beard was an assistant coach and associate head coach at Texas Tech from 2001-11 and worked his way through small-college ranks -- first at McMurry University in Abilene, Texas -- as a head coach.
"Most importantly, this is an award that we won this year," Beard said. "I was having the same conversation with Jarrett Culver just a couple of weeks ago in my office when he won Big 12 Player of the Year, and Culver and I shared the view that any award you get in athletics in a team sport is team based.
"So I really share this award with everybody, not only on this year's team, but every Texas Tech team we've had as we built this.
"I just really want to thank the players. It's so cool when we're here and we get the award and you guys are here. I don't know what I possibly could have what John Wooden and Bob Knight and Coach Izzo didn't have, but I don't think they had their team 30 minutes removed from practice sitting on the front row when we got the award. This is special. I want to thank each player that played on this year's team. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you guys."
The AP award founded in 1967 went three times to Beard's mentor, Knight, but Beard is the first coach at a Texas university to win the trophy.

AUGUSTA, Georgia — Women will have their day at Augusta National on Saturday when the golf club, once ground zero in the gender equality battle, hosts the final round of the Augusta National Women's Amateur (ANWA).
The word historic has been attached to the first ever competitive women's round at the home of the Masters and the occasion will be given the full treatment, with NBC providing live coverage and Augusta National rolling out the pomp, ceremony and tradition that is its trademark.
The image of 30 women competing at a club which only seven years ago did not have a single female member is being held up as another small victory for equality.
Martha Burk, who put Augusta National's all-male membership policy under a microscope, will not be celebrating mocking the ANWA as a public relations stunt but the 77-year-old activist says she and her group of protesters will take credit for sparking the little progress that has been made.
"I just don't have any doubt about that at all if no public pressure or international spotlight had been shined on it thanks to us they would still be doing the same thing and getting away with it," Burk told Reuters. "I'm sorry I'm just not buying it. 
"People are going to say it is just sour grapes because she did not succeed in her crusade back in 2003 but I think what progress we are seeing is a direct result of what we did."
What Burk did 16 years ago was put unwanted scrutiny on Augusta National Golf Club and its gender discrimination policy.
Founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts and opened for play in 1933, Augusta National became a sanctuary for some of the world's most powerful men and for decades remained unmoved by outside forces and events.
It would be nearly 80 years until Augusta National relented in 2012, with former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier Darla Moore becoming the first women to don the iconic Green Jackets that distinguish members and Masters champions.
Holding up Augusta National as a relic of the past, the National Council of Women's Organisations spearheaded by Burk took their fight to the club's doorstep during 2003 Masters week, drawing the attention of the world's media.
Augusta National could not stop the protest but was able to keep it well away from the club's doorstep, a court order restricting the event to a muddy field out of view of patrons and sponsors.
The protest failed to draw the numbers it hoped for, collapsing into a near farce with clowns and an Elvis impersonator getting as much attention as Burk herself.
While the mood was light, the seriousness of the issue was underscored by Burk having to demonstrate wearing a bullet proof vest while the FBI tapped her phone chasing down death threats.
"If social media had been around I would be dead," Burk said. "I got so many death threats over Augusta, that day I was wearing a bullet proof vest and I had hired body guards because people were just rampant about it and I really do believe if social media had existed somebody would have tracked me down and shot me."
ABSOLUTE SECRECY
One of the world's most exclusive clubs, Augusta National operates in absolute secrecy. Even the smallest detail such as who dry cleans the Green Jackets is classified.
The club's most heavily guarded secret, however, is its membership and when Burk was leaked a list of the 300 Green Jackets her group mounted a campaign urging consumers to boycott Masters sponsors.
Her organization also facilitated two sex discrimination lawsuits against Smith Barney, a division of Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley, whose CEOs were Augusta members, and collected $79 million in settlements. 
It was that legal action, Burk believes, that produced the first cracks in Augusta National's resolve.
"I did not feel particularly defeated," said Burk, reflecting on her 2003 protest. "I know people expected me to go crawl into a hole and never come out because we weren't successful but we just kept trucking along.
"We had a list of all the members and the companies they were affiliated with and I think the club knew that they weren't going to be the last two lawsuits.
"I knew you could not put that genie back in the bottle it was going to come up as it has every year. 
"I knew that eventually something would come of it.
"Will they ever be true converts as opposed to Easter Sunday Christians? I don't know but at least they are making the right noises. 
"It is never going to go away for them."

WELLINGTON — All Blacks fullback Israel Dagg has retired from all rugby at the age of 30 after struggling with a long-term knee injury, he said on Friday.
World Cup winner Dagg, who played the last of his 66 tests on the wing against Argentina in 2017, decided to call time on his career after receiving medical advice.
"As a little kid growing up in Hawkes bay I never in my wildest dreams thought I would have travelled the road I have with Rugby," Dagg said in a post on Instagram.
"Unfortunately my dream career has come to an end due to a increasingly painful and unfixable right knee, my rugby days are over."
One of a raft of brilliant outside backs brought into the All Blacks side by Graham Henry, Dagg made his test debut against Ireland at the age of 22 and played a starring role in the side's 2011 World Cup triumph the following year.
Dagg scored five tries in five matches in the tournament and started at fullback in the final against France.
Blessed with searing pace, skill and vision, Dagg scored 26 tries in all for the All Blacks and set up countless others through a sparkling eight-year international career.
He also played a total of 112 Super Rugby matches for the Otago Highlanders and the Canterbury Crusaders, claiming back-to-back titles with the latter in 2017-18. 
Dagg suffered a season-ending knee injury in his final test in 2017 and managed only a handful of appearances for the Crusaders during their successful title defence last year.
He said he would continue at the reigning Super Rugby champions in a mentoring role for the rest of the season.
"While it's bittersweet to mark the end of my playing career, I'm grateful to still be able to contribute to this Crusaders team in 2019 and help prepare some of the younger squad members to take the next step in their own careers," he said in a New Zealand Rugby media release.
"On a personal note, I'm looking forward to taking on some new challenges in the future, and looking forward to spending more time with my young family."
New Zealand's rugby community paid tribute to a player who started in 63 of his 66 tests and played 49 at fullback, second only to Mils Muliaina in the position.
"It's always a shame when injury forces a player to retire, but 'Izzy' will leave our game knowing that he'll forever be remembered as an outstanding player who definitely enhanced the All Blacks jersey and contributed to the legacy of the team," All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said.
"We'll all miss his outstanding rugby skills on the field, but he was a real character off the field as well.  We'll look back fondly at his time in the black jersey - he's a very special man and a very special player."

The NBA reportedly is investigating an incident involving New Orleans Pelicans beleaguered forward Anthony Davis, who is shown on an Instagram video giving the middle finger to a fan as he walks off the court after Wednesday night's home loss to the Charlotte Hornets.
According to NOLA.com, a fan at Smoothie King Arena shouted "F--- you, AD," which caused him to flip off the disgruntled spectator.
Davis, who requested a trade from the Pelicans before the February trade deadline, pointed out that his gesture was not directed at the team or the city of New Orleans.
"Never disrespected the city and never will," Davis said on the Instagram account Pelicans Wave. "But of course they not gonna show what the fan said."
The Pelicans security team was near Davis and the team reportedly is cooperating with league officials regarding the incident. Without Davis in the lineup since March 24 (lower back spasms), the Pelicans continue to struggle and dropped to 32-47 with the 115-109 loss to the Hornets.
Several problems with fans have occurred during this NBA season, including one in which a spectator engaged in "inappropriate interaction" with Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook during a March game against the Utah Jazz in Salt Lake City.
Shane Keisel, who publicly revealed he was the fan involved, was permanently banned by the club from attending any events at the arena.
Westbrook said after the contest that he was the victim of a disrespectful comment that he took as a racial barb. Westbrook was fined $25,000 by the NBA for "directing profanity and threatening language to a fan."
The Jazz said they conducted an investigation through video and eyewitness accounts and Keisel's ban is based on "excessive and derogatory verbal abuse directed at a player" that serves as a violation of the NBA Code of Conduct.
Also in March, New York Knicks owner James Dolan called a confrontation with a fan an "ambush," and banned the heckling spectator from Madison Square Garden. In January, the Dallas Mavericks banned a fan for the rest of the season after an investigation reportedly showed he behaved inappropriately toward guard Patrick Beverley of the Los Angeles Clippers.

(Reuters) - Charles Leclerc missed out on his first Formula One victory in Bahrain last weekend because of an unprecedented short-circuit in an injection system control unit, his Ferrari team said on Friday.
The 21-year-old Monegasque driver will be able to use the same power unit in China next week, round three of the championship.
Leclerc finished third at Sakhir after his car lost power with some 10 laps to go while he was leading the race comfortably.
Race winner Lewis Hamilton and his Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas both overtook the youngster before the chequered flag, with the Leclerc salvaging a podium place thanks to the safety car being deployed for the last three laps. 
Ferrari said the problem had never been seen before on that particular component.
Leclerc had also started on pole position for the first time in his Formula One career, and in only his second race with Ferrari.
Shanghai will be the 1,000th Formula One championship grand prix and Ferrari will be favourites to win despite champions Mercedes finishing one-two against the odds in the first two races of the season.

LISBON — Plans to reform and possible expand European club competition ran into opposition on Friday as the continent's leagues declared they were 'united' in their determination to protect domestic football.
The European Leagues umbrella group said it would take a more active role in influencing public opinion and shaping the future of football on the continent and reiterated its claim that fans prefer domestic league action to UEFA competition.
Meanwhile, the English Premier League, one of the European Leagues' 35 members, said its 20 clubs would "vigorously defend" it against any plans to impose a new calendar. 
UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said on being re-elected in February that he would work with the European Club Association (ECA), which groups 232 of the region's biggest clubs, to "design the club competitions of the future."
The ECA, in turn, said it wanted more teams playing more matches in continental competitions. 
European Leagues, which says it represents 900-plus clubs through its affiliates including "those who are not normally playing European football", said domestic football should remain the priority.
"Our main objective is to safeguard the domestic competitions and protect the domestic competitions if needed," its president Lars-Christer Olsson told a news conference.
"These are the most important to the fans, they are much more important than any international competitions."
Olsson added: "These are interesting times. When it comes to real issues, I am happy to see all leagues are united."
Although UEFA has only just started discussing its plans, Olsson said it was important that the public knew what was happening. 
"We have to make the views of the European Leagues known to everyone, not only stakeholders but also fans and the public so everyone knows what is going on and how we are preparing for the future club competitions," he said.
Olsson added that the last 10 years had been negative for domestic leagues as revenue from UEFA competition had increased the gap between the richest clubs and the rest.
The Premier League said that in a statement that it had "significant concerns" over reported plans to change the format and qualifying criteria for European tournaments.
"All clubs unanimously agreed it is inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures, calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game and will work together to protect the Premier League," it said.
"We have a fantastic combination of competitive football and committed fans that we will vigorously defend," it continued, adding that allegiances and local rivalries were often passed down through generations.
The Premier League said it would ensure that "European football bodies understand the importance of this, and their obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football."

BARCELONA — Diego Simeone called on his Atletico Madrid side to show their true colours when they face La Liga leaders Barcelona on Saturday in a crucial title clash.
Barcelona hold an eight-point lead over second-placed Atletico, which would be reduced to five if the visitors can win at the Nou Camp.
Atletico, however, have never beaten the Catalans in the top flight since Simeone took charge in December 2011.
"That we've never won at the Nou Camp (actually) makes me very optimistic," Simeone told reporters on Friday.
"If we win tomorrow and then we don't win the next games, it counts for nothing. Tomorrow we have to show the identity which this team has."
After Atletico were knocked out of the Champions League by Juventus in the last 16, their hopes of glory this season are pinned on winning La Liga.
Barcelona are fighting for the treble but coach Ernesto Valverde is not taking anything for granted.
Valverde says even if his team beat Atletico, extending their lead to 11 points with seven matches remaining, the title race will not be over.
"Many people said La Liga was over in January and later, when you don't win, and your rivals do, the title race is back on," Valverde told a news conference.
"While the mathematics don't say (it's over), you have to keep going until the end."
Valverde says he wants to maintain the team's usual style, even up against an abrasive side like Atletico.
"We will try to stay faithful to our game," added the coach.
"The three points are very important to both teams, in our case to extend our advantage and for them to cut the gap. Mathematically the distance is not definitive."

LONDON — The Williams Formula One team reported increased revenues in 2018, helped by an unspecified one-off item, despite enduring one of their worst seasons on the track.
The British-based team, the third most successful in the sport's history in terms of wins, said on Friday that financial performance had improved across both Formula One and Williams Advanced Engineering.
Group revenue increased to 176.5 million pounds, from a previous 166.2 million. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) were 12.9 million, up from 10.8 in 2017.
The Formula One business generated revenue of 130.7 million pounds, compared to a previous 125.6 million, with EBITDA unchanged at 16 million.
Williams said the one-off item was non-recurring but gave no details.
They have an all-new line-up this season with Mercedes-backed British rookie George Russell and Poland's Robert Kubica replacing Canadian Lance Stroll and Russian Sergey Sirotkin.
Stroll has joined Racing Point, the former Force India team now controlled by his billionaire father Lawrence, and taken a number of sponsors with him.
Williams, who have not won a race since 2012 and whose last title was in 1997, finished last overall in 2018 with just seven points from 21 races. 
Third overall as recently as 2015, they have yet to score a point in 2019 with a car that is again off the pace.
"Unfortunately, we struggled to maintain the pace of technical development and endured a difficult season," said Group Chief Executive Mike O'Driscoll.
"There is a very large gap in competitive expenditure between the leading teams and the rest of the grid," he added.
"But we are increasingly hopeful that Liberty Media’s long-term vision and plans for the future of the sport can deliver a more level playing field on which all teams can compete fairly."
Formula One's U.S.-based owners Liberty Media are discussing a shake-up of the sport from 2021 with a cost cap and redistribution of revenues among the proposals.
Leading teams like champions Mercedes and Ferrari operate on annual budgets well in excess of $200 million. 
O'Driscoll said the arrival of ROKiT as new title sponsor, replacing departed Martini, had demonstrated the continued strength of the Williams brand.

(Reuters) - Former Olympic gold medalist Peter Kennaugh is taking a break from professional cycling as a result of mental health issues, the rider and his Bora-Hansgrohe team said on Friday.
"Peter will be taking an indefinite break from professional cycling due to ongoing mental health issues," Bora-Hansgrohe said in a statement. 
"The Team supports Peter in his decision and have agreed that this is the best course of action to ensure he can return to full health in the near future."
The 2014 and 2015 British road racing champion was a member of the Team Sky who helped Chris Froome win two of his four Tour de France titles in 2013 and 2015.
The 29-year-old, who won the team pursuit gold medal at the London Olympics with Edward Clancy, Geraint Thomas and Steven Burke, left the British outfit for Bora-Hansgrohe last year.
"I would like to thank everyone at Bora-Hansgrohe for their support and understanding to allow me to recover away from the sport. I wish the team the best of luck for the rest of the season," Kennaugh said.

MUMBAI — India captain Virat Kohli does not want performance at the ongoing Indian Premier League to determine team composition for this year's World Cup but selectors have little choice after a series of candidates failed to nail down the number four slot.
Twice 50-over champions India have an otherwise settled batting line-up with a formidable top order consisting of Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan and Kohli himself.
The selectors, however, continue to fret over who should walk out to bat after the fall of the second wicket during the May 30-July 14 showpiece tournament in England and Wales.
Ajinkya Rahane, Manish Pandey, Lokesh Rahul, Dinesh Karthik and Ambati Rayudu have all been trialled for the number four spot and found wanting.
With the ongoing IPL the only form of cricket left before Kohli's team embarks on their World Cup campaign, the selectors maybe forced to consider the form of the players in the T20 tournament before picking the squad ahead of the April 23 deadline.
"They have maintained that they won't look at IPL but it's going to be very hard," former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar told Reuters in a recent interview. 
"There are some borderline cases, like if they are looking at Dinesh Karthik, Ambati Rayudu and Vijay Shankar or a Manish Pandey or an Ajinkya Rahane. So all these people are there and thereabout.
"And if somebody has a great IPL season, it will be hard to ignore him, but they (selectors) should not actually get too carried away with what happens in the IPL."
Rayudu, 33, emerged as the most likely choice to fill the void but scores of 13, 18 and two in the first three matches of the recent home series against world champions Australia hurt his cause.
Pressure is only mounting on the selectors with Rayudu, who plays for IPL champions Chennai Super Kings, scoring 28, five, one and zero in the first four matches of the tournament.
Manjrekar felt India were back to square one with no more ODIs scheduled before the World Cup in England and Wales, where the team will be looking to add to their 1983 and 2011 triumphs.
India's limited-overs vice-captain, Rohit, believes inputs from Kohli and coach Ravi Shastri should determine the selection of the final 15.
"With their inputs, the selectors will keep an eye on what is happening with those guys during the IPL," Rohit, who leads the Mumbai Indians side in the IPL, told reporters at the launch of cricket.com website on Thursday. 
"Although I feel IPL shouldn't be the criterion for team selection. We have played enough international matches to see where each individual stands.
"You can't select a 50-overs format team based on a 20-overs franchise competition. IPL is a different ball game, it's franchise cricket.
"Yes form matters a lot. But in this last four years we have played enough ODI matches, we have played enough T20 internationals. So that should be enough to understand that these are the players we want."

Free agent linebacker Kyle Emanuel announced his retirement from the NFL on Thursday.
Selected by the San Diego Chargers in the fifth round of the 2015 NFL draft, Emanuel spent four years with the franchise. He has played in 63 games for the franchise. A Nebraska native, he played collegiately at FCS powerhouse North Dakota State.
He played out his four-year, $2.5 million rookie contract and had visited the Detroit Lions and had drawn other interest from other teams, according to multiple reports.
In his Twitter post on Thursday, the 27-year-old Emanuel said injuries have played a part in his retirement.
"There is no one specific reason why I came to this decision, but as I contemplated it this offseason, something told me it was time to walk away," he wrote. "Although it wasn't the sole reason, the injuries have started to pile up and I had to take my long-term health into consideration. I have no idea what will come next which is scary and exciting at the same time but I can't wait to get started on whatever it is."
Emanuel ends his career with 133 tackles (11 for loss), 10 quarterback hits, four sacks and two interceptions.

(Reuters) - Liverpool's pressing ability combined with their speed and organisation make them incredibly difficult to beat in the Premier League, Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuettl said on Thursday.
The south coast club host second-placed Liverpool on Friday and Hasenhuettl, who was appointed in December, said they are not afraid to take on a team that has lost only once in the league this season.
"It's the first time we play against a very good pressing team," Hasenhuettl told reporters. "How they play is a perfect example of a physically strong team combined with the technical qualities, speed and good organisation.
"So you can think about why it is so hard to win against this team. Only one team has done this and that is Manchester City.
"This doesn't mean we're frightened, we're not afraid of walking out on the pitch. We know that we're playing at home, we know that we have the crowd behind us and they are pushing us."
Since Hasenhuettl's appointment, Southampton have won seven games with the Austrian manager lifting them out of the relegation zone and into 16th place. 
Liverpool boss Juergen Klopp praised Hasenhuettl on Wednesday, saying he had done an "incredible" job to turn around the club's fortunes by trusting young players in their bid to avoid the drop.
"I think he uses very often warm words for the opposition managers," Hasenhuettl added. "I know him as a very honest guy and I know that if he says something then it's not only a tactic but it's honest.
"He has known me for a long time although we didn't play a lot of times against each other. We had our coaching badges, we were starting them together."
Southampton's on-loan striker Danny Ings is ineligible to play against his parent club and Hasenhuettl said Shane Long was an option after the forward, who missed the last game with a groin injury, returned to training.
Midfielder Mario Lemina, however, remains sidelined with an abdominal injury that has kept him out of action since December.
"Long is back in training and is an option," the manager said. "(Defender) Jannik Vestergaard is training too but if he is not ready then Jack Stephens is an alternative.
"It's a pity that Mario Lemina is not back in training again because he still has problems this week so he needed more rest. We're trying to bring him back to the right level... but it isn't easy when he has had such a long time without playing."

Alex Morgan scored her 100th international goal and substitute Mallory Pugh scored twice when the U.S. Women's National Team rallied to defeat Australia 5-3 in a friendly at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colo., on Thursday.
Megan Rapinoe broke a 2-2 tie in the 61st minute with a strike from 22 yards out for her 44th goal. Pugh, from Highland Ranch, Colo., replaced Rapinoe and her first touch extended the lead to 4-2 in the 67th minute with Emily Sonnett earning her second assist.
Samantha Kerr's header pulled Australia to a 4-3 deficit in the 81st minute but Pugh chipped in the insurance goal in the fifth minute of stoppage time.
Morgan opened the scoring in the 14th minute to become the 17th woman to reach the century mark. She is tied for sixth on the all-time U.S. list with Tiffeny Milbrett and has 27 goals in her past 32 matches.
She has scored in 70 of her 159 games, with the U.S. going 60-0-10.
Morgan controlled an overhead ball by bodying defender Clare Polkinghorne. She dribbled the left flank toward the top of the penalty area before making a cutback on defender Alanna Kennedy to create space for the shot from 16 yards that went into the far netting.
Lisa De Vanna made it 1-1 in the 29th minute from the left side following a layoff by Caitlin Foord.
The U.S responded but couldn't break the deadlock. Ellie Carpenter cleared a shot by Rapinoe in the 32nd minute; goalkeeper Lydia Williams denied Colorado native Lindsey Horan in the 34th and Rose Lavelle a minute later.
Foord gave Australia a 2-1 lead in the 47th minute, but the U.S. got the equalizer six minutes later with Tobin Heath's header.
The U.S. has three more friendlies before the start of the 2019 Women's World Cup in France in June, beginning with Belgium on Sunday at Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles.

(Reuters) - Forward Alex Morgan reached a personal milestone with her 100th international goal as the United States beat Australia 5-3 in a friendly in Colorado on Thursday.
In opening the scoring in the 15th minute with a superb solo run capped by a precise finish, Morgan became the seventh American woman -- 17th from any country -- to reach the century mark.
It was far from smooth sailing for the reigning World Cup champions, who fell behind Australia early in the second half in front of a sellout crowd in suburban Denver.
The home team, however, scored three times in 14 minutes to regain the lead for good in an entertaining encounter between two of the favorites heading into World Cup in France in June.
Local favorite Mallory Pugh made it 4-2 by scoring less than a minute after coming on, before adding a second with a deft dink over the keeper in the final minute of stoppage time to seal the result.
Earlier, Australia equalized on the half hour when pacy veteran winger Lisa De Vanna fired home.
Caitlin Foord gave Australia the lead early in the second half, before Tobin Heath and Megan Rapinoe put the U.S. ahead again.
Samantha Kerr scored with a thumping header in the 82nd minute to give Australia some hope, but the visitors could not find an equalizer.
"We can't let that many goals in ... but they're a great attacking team so you've got to give them credit," said veteran Rapinoe after her 150th appearance for the U.S.
The Americans continue their World Cup preparation with another friendly against Belgium in California on Sunday.

The Dallas Cowboys and franchise-tagged defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence agreed to a five-year contract, the team announced Friday.
Multiple media outlets reported the deal is worth $105 million, with $65 million guaranteed and more money in the first year ($31.1 million) than any non-quarterback contract in NFL history, breaking the mark set by Khalil Mack last fall.
According to The MMQB, the deal also sets new benchmarks among defensive players in percentage of total and full guarantees on a long-term contract. Mack, the NFL's highest-paid defender at $23.5 million annually, received $90 million guaranteed for injury and $60 million fully guaranteed at signing.
Earlier Friday, NFL Network reported Lawrence and the Cowboys were making progress after negotiations appeared to be stalled last week.
Dallas executive vice president Stephen Jones said last week the sides were at an "impasse," adding, "We're apart. But certainly optimistic. ... We'll continue to chop wood."
The Cowboys tagged Lawrence in March for the second year in a row, giving them until July 15 to sign him to a long-term extension. Lawrence played the 2018 season on his $17.1 million tender, and he could have made $20.5 million on the tag in 2019, but reports had indicated he was unlikely to participate in training camp if he didn't receive a long-term extension.
Lawrence, who turns 27 on April 28, reportedly was seeking a multiyear deal worth upward of the $20.5 million tag amount. He also reportedly planned to delay the shoulder surgery he needs until a long-term resolution was reached, which could explain why there was urgency to reach a deal now and not closer to the July 15 deadline.
Over the past two seasons, Lawrence has a combined 25 sacks, 49 quarterback hits and 122 tackles. The Cowboys selected the Boise State product in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft.

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — The summer of 2015 found the University of North Carolina in what some, including Jay M. Smith, a professor at the university, would characterize as a curious position.
A year earlier, a university-commissioned report had found that the African and Afro-American Studies Department had offered nearly 200 fraudulent classes over almost two decades. These classes had been disproportionately populated by athletes in the high-profile sports of football and basketball, who in some cases were steered by athletic department tutors who knew the courses required little work.
The result was one of the worst academic scandals in college sports history, and a huge black mark on a prestigious university and its proud athletic program. The university’s accreditation body placed North Carolina on probation. The N.C.A.A. conducted an investigation.
But critics saw few systemic changes.
“There’d been none of these public forums, no signs of lessons learned,” Smith said recently.
A history professor whose area of study is pre-Revolutionary France, Smith had been agitating about the scandal for several years. He had even written a book about the affair, “Cheated,” with a former learning specialist who helped blow the whistle on the classes.
“I thought, I cannot rely on this institution to do the right thing,” Smith said, “and I think it would be an abdication of responsibility for us to pass up the opportunity to provide students at this institution an opportunity to learn about their scandal — how it happened, what it says about college sports, what it tells us about the plight of athletes.”
And that is why earlier this week, as the men’s college basketball world turned its attention to the Final Four — an event the Tar Heels qualified for in 2016 and 2017, winning the title in the latter year — well over 100 undergraduates heard Smith lecture on the scandal as part of his increasingly popular course, History 383: Big-Time College Sports and the Rights of Athletes, 1874 to the Present.
Students in the class read “Cheated” and “Pay for Play: A History of Big-Time College Athletic Reform,” by Ronald A. Smith, as well as articles about the post-Civil War underpinnings of college football and the struggles of female and black athletes. The last quarter of the class, beginning this week, concerns the North Carolina scandal, including the much smaller controversy that arose over the course itself.
Smith is not trolling the university with the class, he said, although he wondered whether his superiors took it that way when two senior administrators seemed to be pressuring the then-department chair to cancel the course a few years ago. (The officials said their questions about the course had nothing to do with its content. The provost overturned a grievance committee’s finding that the officials’ interference had been undue.)
More righteous than self-righteous, Smith said the course is an earnest attempt to fight for a fairer college sports system, at North Carolina and elsewhere.
His class, he insisted, does not have an agenda. But it certainly has a point of view. And that includes the notion that efforts like the class itself are futile.
“By examining all these earlier episodes of growth followed by hand-wringing and efforts at reform, which inevitably fail — what they see is there are systemic features in college athletics that hardened over time and became ever more intractable,” Smith said.
Smith provides an unsentimental education that suggests a messy reality, one in which the scandal resulted from the workings of the college sports industry, including how it prevents athletes from getting a piece of the profits they generate.
While Smith has clarified in class that he is antagonistic to the college sports industry rather than to college athletes, this ambiguity leads to misconceptions, according to Lydia Thompson, a senior on the rowing team who is taking the class.
“Students hear critiques of the ways in which athletes have been abused by the educational system,” Thompson wrote in an email, “and automatically extrapolate those critiques and apply them to athletes who merely have to abide by the rules of that system.”
Smith has taught at Chapel Hill since 1990, having arrived during the era of good feelings associated with the legendary late basketball coach Dean Smith (no relation). “I drank the Kool-Aid,” he said.
Within three years of his arrival, though, according to a university report, the academic fraud had begun. It did not begin to come to light until 2011, right around when Jay Smith’s involvement with it commenced.
That summer, a football player named Mike McAdoo sued the university and the N.C.A.A. over his ineligibility related to another instance of academic misconduct. A student-run honors court had suspended him for submitting a paper in a Swahili class for which a tutor had formatted footnotes. But the paper, which was disclosed in court filings, included plagiarism, and that discovery led to a stream of revelations that eventually exposed the fake-classes scandal.
Smith was serving on a faculty committee overseeing the honors court. When a reporter asked to discuss McAdoo, Smith looked up the paper and was “flabbergasted,” he said, not only by its blatant evidence of plagiarism, but also because he knew the ostensible instructor of the course, Julius Nyang’oro, was not a language instructor. (Nyang’oro, the African and Afro-American Studies chair, was later found to be complicit in the scandal.)
“All of this smelled really, really fishy to me,” Smith said.
Smith and a few other faculty members convened an ad hoc group for academic reform. A neophyte when it came to college athletics, Smith was tutored by Richard Southall, a professor who directed the university’s College Sport Research Institute.
Southall, whose institute is now housed at the University of South Carolina, said he gave the group a “primer” on college sports, with the thesis that scandals are the regular, inevitable consequence of the conflict between the N.C.A.A.’s amateurism model and market forces such as fan interest and player value.
“Players understand their market value, coaches understand it, everybody understands it,” Southall said in an interview.
To hear Smith tell it, the course, first taught over the summer of 2016, came naturally to him. As a historian, he said, “you look for developments over time, charting both continuities and change, and you identify the issues that seem to be at stake.”
“I want them to leave the class with a reform spirit,” he added. “I want them to have a fresh appreciation for the way the system mistreats the athletes and why we need radical new thinking to correct those inequities.”
Ally Mastroianni, a sophomore on North Carolina’s lacrosse team, said she had enrolled in Smith’s class out of a sense of responsibility. “I did want to learn about the scandal,” she said. “I feel as an athlete I should know the facts.”
Her days are long, she said, filled with practice, rehab, classes, meals, homework and maybe some social time. Her main complaint about the relatively new Loudermilk Center for Excellence, a state-of-the-art athlete support center in the football stadium, is that it does not stay open past 10 p.m.
“When I see people rolling their eyes, it’s hurtful,” she said of her classmates’ attitude toward Loudermilk, which Smith’s students toured. “I don’t think it’s just a sham.”
Still, she did not regret enrolling in Smith’s course. It is, she said, “probably the most interesting class I’ve taken at U.N.C.”

The right bra can beat bounce and end chafing — and it might change the way you work out.
By Anna Perling
Ms. Perling is a staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company.
At 12 years old, Holly Powell quit the swim team when her breasts outgrew her swimsuit. In college, she started jogging. “There were no sports bras for me back then,” Ms. Powell said, now 50 and still a regular exerciser. “I had broken blood vessels all across the top of my bust.”
When Ms. Powell went sports bra shopping, salespeople told her they didn’t sell bras in her size. In 2011, Ms. Powell, who lives in Portland, Oregon, left her career as a teacher and librarian to open her own bra store, The Pencil Test. Her store now stocks 125 sizes, from 28D to 48G, while regular bra stores stock 25 to 30, she said. “It was a case of ‘If no one else is doing it, do it yourself.’”
Ms. Powell’s store is unique, but the problems her customers face are not — and they’re common to both casual exercisers and more serious athletes. 
Before finding a bra that fit right, Robin Proctor, 58, of Lake Lure, North Carolina, would chafe until she nearly bled on long mountain bike rides. “On a hot day, you feel like you physically beat yourself in the chest because your breasts are bouncing around,” she said. Ms. Proctor eventually found a bra, the Enell Sport, capable of locking down her breasts (the material, she said, is like Kevlar).
In a recent study, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia found a strong relationship between breast size and regular exercise. In short, women with larger breasts were more discouraged from working out. Out of 82 women with breasts categorized as large, 46 percent said their breast size affected their exercise routine and 58 percent of the 43 women with breasts categorized as very large reported the same (researchers categorized sizes by volume rather than relying on bra size).
The good news is that a better bra can significantly increase comfort during exercise. A 2012 study from the University of Portsmouth in England found that a correctly fitting bra can reduce breast pain. Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Wollongong recently developed their own app to help people find the right fit. (Wirecutter recommends these five sports bras for different cup sizes.)
Ms. Powell has witnessed firsthand how a superior sports bra can impact emotional as well as physical health. “I’ve had people come to me saying, ‘My personal best improved, I go to the gym more often,’” she said. “Having a bra that fits you deeply affects your self-esteem.”
When possible, get a professional fitting and try on as many bras as possible in a store. If a professional fitting isn’t an option, the subreddit r/ABraThatFits hosts a dynamic size calculator that considers six over-bust and under-bust measurements from different angles, far beyond the typical two. The group’s members often help with fit checks based on photos or descriptions, as do the bloggers on the website Bratabase. Sizing is inconsistent between brands, but many companies offer a sizing chart you can use to find the best option based on your own measurements.
Although many sports bras come in basic small, medium, large, and extra large sizes, some use a familiar sizing system that includes both cup measurements (A, B, C, D, E, F and so on) and band measurements (32, 34, 40, 44 and so on). Styles that use cup and band measurements have more sizes to help you fine-tune your fit.
After measuring, you may come up with a size that isn’t available at a major retailer. Ms. Powell suggests looking for brands with U.K. sizing, which generally offer more cup size options. You can find these at online retailers like HerRoom and Bare Necessities.
Sports bras come in three major styles: compression, encapsulation and combination. Compression bras hug the breasts close to the body to stop bouncing. Most aren’t adjustable and come in relatively few sizes. They usually have a wide solid front panel, which can mush breasts together to create a “uniboob” look.
Encapsulation bras look like fashion bras. They separate breasts into two distinct cups and provide support through seaming, molding or underwire. Typically, encapsulation bras offer more, better-fitting options than compression bras.
Combination bras offer aspects of both designs. Breasts move laterally as well as up and down during high-impact exercise, and a combination bra is often the best choice to control movement.
Some more constructed sports bras, especially encapsulation styles, can look Madonna-esque. But don’t worry about aesthetics if a bra offers you the best support, advises LaJean Lawson, a scientist and consultant for the sportswear brand Champion. “Have that boldness to say, ‘I’m going to put that personal bias aside to try new things even if they look like my grandma’s bra,’” she said.
Hook your bra on the loosest setting (you can tighten the band as the material stretches over time). Then, situate your breasts. “Take a hand inside from under the armpit and scoop it inside the cup” and then smooth the top of your tissue so that everything settles, advised Iris Clarke, the owner of Iris Lingerie in Brooklyn, New York.
Most of a bra’s support comes from the band, so it should be snug, with about a half inch of give — you can put two fingers between the band and your back to check. Raise your arms above your head to see if the band rides up or gapes. Check the straps to make sure they feel snug without digging in or falling off your shoulders, and adjust the length accordingly.
Move on to the cups, which should fully cover your breasts. If you have spillage, you may need to size up. If the fabric is baggy and wrinkly, size down.
If you’re evaluating an encapsulation bra, look at the triangle-shaped section that falls between your breasts, called the “gore.” It should lie flat. If the bra has wires, they should sit under the breasts, without digging into your sides or riding up onto the breast tissue (if this happens, size up).
Look for bras with adjustable bands and straps so you can tweak your fit. If your breasts are two sizes, Ms. Clarke recommends fitting for the larger breast for more coverage.

The sports radio personality Craig Carton was sentenced to three and a half years in prison on Friday by a longtime fan and listener — the judge — for a ticket reselling scheme that ended his broadcast partnership with the former N.F.L. quarterback Boomer Esiason.
Carton, convicted in November of conspiracy, wire fraud and securities fraud, was sentenced by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan federal court.
She greeted him like a radio listener.
“Good afternoon, Mr. Carton. Colleen from New York. First time, long time,” the judge said, adding that she used to listen to his show as she drove to court.
“I knew you could be fun to listen to,” she said. “I also knew you could be a jerk.”
The prison term was half of what prosecutors sought after Carton was convicted at a November trial of soliciting and then largely gambling away nearly $7 million.
Geoffrey S. Berman, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a release that Carton’s ticket resale business, which purported to use his connections to obtain good seats for events like Metallica and Barbra Streisand concerts, was an “elaborate fiction.”
Carton, a 50-year-old Manhattan resident, blamed his fall from a measure of celebrity and wealth on “wildly stupid decisions” he made as he tried to cope with memories of being sexually abused at age 11.
He said memories of the abuse were set off by revelations of the crimes of Jerry Sandusky, a former Penn State football assistant who was convicted of child sexual abuse in 2012. That led him first to speak angrily and more emotionally than he ever had before on WFAN’s “Boomer and Carton” show, which he co-hosted for years with Esiason. Then he could not sleep.
“Nobody knows what it’s like when lights go out and you lay in bed awake and the demons come,” Carton said.
He recalled turning to blackjack and eventually developing a gambling addiction so serious that winning and losing became irrelevant.
Carton said his arrest in 2017 was a “lightning bolt of awareness for me.” He said he had joined Gamblers Anonymous and was undergoing therapy.
“I am truly powerless over this disease,” Carton said. His last bet — a loss — came in June, he added.
Before describing the sentence, the judge said she had enjoyed Carton’s show, except when it became too “raunchy.”
But she likened his crimes to those of the financier Bernard L. Madoff, who is serving a 150-year prison sentence, though she said Madoff’s scheme, in which he squandered roughly $20 billion, went on far longer.
The judge dismissed Carton’s claims that he never meant to lose investors’ money, saying it was a common justification in financial crimes.
“The money always runs out at some point, and only then do you realize the road to your personal hell was truly paved with your good intentions,” she said.
“Craig Carton, you have indeed descended into a hell of your own making,” the judge said. “Everything you spent a lifetime of building up is gone. Your marriage is over. Your family is decimated. Your kids are terrified. Your career is in tatters. Your reputation is lost.”
She did, however, praise Carton’s plan to publicly urge others to stop gambling as she ordered him to pay $4.8 million in restitution and to forfeit $4.2 million. He also must do 150 hours of community service.
She said Carton could perhaps someday resume a radio show, which he left after his arrest, but she noted one of the biggest advertisers on sports radio shows seemed to be legal gambling businesses.
“That troubles me,” the judge said.
Carton must report to prison on July 15.

INDIANAPOLIS — NBC Sports will use retired NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. in its inaugural broadcast of the Indianapolis 500 next month.
The second-year analyst will be part of a team that features 14 commentators and host Mike Tirico and analyst Danica Patrick.
Earnhardt will be a roving reporter for his first Indianapolis 500 on May 26, contributing to pre-race, in-race and post-race coverage alongside Rutledge Wood. Earnhardt Jr., who will also be featured from Indianapolis Motor Speedway during race week, was used extensively by the network in his first year after retirement with reporting trips to last year's Winter Olympics in South Korea and the Super Bowl.
NBC Sports motorsports host Krista Voda will also join Earnhardt at Indianapolis.
The broadcast booth will be NBC Sports' full-time IndyCar crew of play-by-play announcer Leigh Diffey and analysts Paul Tracy and Townsend Bell. The 14 total commentators will be the most ever for NBC Sports' coverage of IndyCar as the network plans to treat the Indy 500 as one of its showcase events. ABC had broadcast the "Greatest Spectacle in Racing" exclusively since 1965 in the second-longest-running partnership of its kind until NBC purchased the rights to air the entire 2019 IndyCar schedule.
Marty Snider, Kelli Stavast, Kevin Lee and Jon Beekhuis will be the pit reporters for the Indy 500, along with reporters Robin Miller and Dillon Welch.

(Reuters) - Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) featherweight Artem Lobov, a long-time friend and team mate of Conor McGregor, is set to make a lucrative debut in bare-knuckle boxing as combat sports bid to gain more mainstream acceptance. 
Nicknamed the "Russian Hammer", Lobov told Reuters he had accepted a big payday from the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship to fight another UFC veteran, Jason Knight, on a pay-per-view card in Biloxi, Mississippi on Saturday. 
"I'd be lying if I didn't tell you that money was a big factor in signing for Bare Knuckle - we're prize fighters, and our success is measured by the size of our purse," he said during a stopover in New York. 
Long considered the only realistic professional alternative outside of boxing for combat sports athletes, the UFC is now competing with other mixed martial arts and grappling promotions. 
European and Asian promotions are attracting sellout crowds, and the Bellator organization recently signed a large number of British and Irish prospects to try to make inroads in Europe. 
They were also on the trail of Lobov when he was released from the UFC in January.
"They made a very nice offer, a lot more than I was getting in the UFC, but it did not match the offer that Bare Knuckle made. With Bare Knuckle, I can also accept other offers as long as it doesn't interfere with their schedule, so it's a win-win for me," the 32-year-old said. 
"I get to go in, fight bare-knuckle, make a lot of money, hopefully build a better name for myself and then see what else is out there."
FRONT FOOT
Though he has a losing professional record of 14 wins and 15 losses, Lobov is hugely popular with fans due to his fearless style of fighting off his front foot and his toughness, with 12 of his MMA losses coming by decision. 
Lobov brushes aside the suggestion that bare-knuckle boxing is more primitive than MMA. 
"It might seem that way, but getting hit with a bare knuckle is not as raw as getting hit with a bare knee, or getting kicked with a shin to your head, which I have been a few times," he said. "In that sense, it's nothing.
"I truly, truly love fighting, so that's not an issue for me. It's like saying to a swimmer, 'Do you mind getting wet?' Of course not, he's a swimmer," he said. 
Lobov credits Irishman McGregor, the former UFC featherweight and lightweight champion, with bringing combat sports into the mainstream in the U.S. and enabling him and many others to make a living as fighters. 
"In many ways it is thanks to Conor, for sure, and it's definitely a lot better than before, but the best times are still ahead of us," Lobov said. 
"Ten years ago I fought a top-10 European fighter on four days' notice for 400 pounds, and to go from that to where I am now, earning six figures for a fight? Certainly, I see the improvements in the sport."
Though delighted to have a chance to test his boxing without the threat of kicks or takedowns, Lobov will be back in the MMA cage soon. 
"I always seek the biggest challenge and MMA is the biggest challenge. I'm still grappling, I'm still wrestling and doing everything," he said. 
"I want to improve and to achieve many, many things in MMA, boxing and bare-knuckle boxing."

COPENHAGEN — The squats and leg lifts were harder than they looked, and after a few sets, Alfonso Aguirre Rodriguez placed his hands on his knees and attempted to compose himself.
In November, Aguirre, a 24-year-old professional video game player from Spain, joined the five-man roster of Origen, a League of Legends team that competes in the game’s top European league. The players — all signed in late fall — were told at the time that the team might be run a bit differently from what they were accustomed to. Now here they were, five young men who make their living sitting almost completely still in front of desktop computers, sweating through an hourlong workout in a cramped gym.
“I think I’m going to puke my oatmeal,” said Aguirre, who is known in the gaming community as Mithy. “I’m dying.”
Some years ago, traditional sports leagues were revolutionized by young analysts wielding computers. The way things had always been done, it turned out, was not always the best way to do things. Now echoes of that transformation have arrived in the growing world of professional e-sports, where gamers are being shepherded toward a new frontier, oddly, by the old, corporeal wisdom of traditional sports.
The debate about whether competitive gamers can be considered athletes may never end. In the meantime, though, gamers are increasingly acting like them.
Origen is one of two teams owned by Rfrsh Entertainment, an e-sports company based in Copenhagen. Two years ago, the organization hired Kasper Hvidt, a former captain of Denmark’s national handball team, to be its sporting director. Hvidt, 43, had no previous exposure to gaming. But that was the point.
E-sports in recent years have crept into the mainstream, attracting new fans, new sponsors and new investment. The top professionals now make six-figure salaries and earn even more with endorsements and prize money. And yet, Hvidt observed, their approach to performance remained amateurish.
Eating right, sleeping right, exercising, cleaning up for sponsors — these ideas have undergirded traditional sports for generations. In e-sports, they are regarded as almost radical.
“They don’t look at themselves as physical human beings,” said Hvidt, who won the European handball championship with Denmark in 2008.
“It’s common sense, in a way. But with them it was not.”
Rfrsh has a validating narrative under its belt. The company’s other team, Astralis, which competes internationally in the first-person shooter game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, had gone almost a year without winning a tournament when Hvidt joined the organization in mid-2017. In 2018, the team earned $3.7 million in prize money while putting together one of the most dominant years ever by any team in any e-sports game.
And so Origen this year has set off on the same journey of athletic self-improvement. As recently as last year, the players’ typical day might have been a sedentary extravaganza of sugary energy drinks, fast food and unresolved psychic tension. Now, their days are interposed with protein smoothies, yoga mats and slow-paced breathing exercises.
The effects of those changes, the team said, have been plain to see: After starting the current season with a 1-4 record, Origen went on a tear, winning 11 of its final 13 matches, finishing the regular season in second place and securing a first-round bye for the playoffs, which began Friday.
“These are little things,” Fabian Broich, Origen’s assistant coach, said. “But they add up, and over the long term you have a more emotionally stable team and a more focused team.”
At Rfrsh, Hvidt has assembled a performance team — a physical trainer, a sports psychologist, a massage therapist, a medical doctor and a nutritionist — and constructed a lifestyle plan for the players that combines scientific research, old-school sports wisdom and simple common sense. Broich, 28, a former professional soccer player from Germany, acts as a liaison between the management team and the players, implementing the principles on the ground.
The players, who hail from five European countries and range in age from 18 to 24, live in Denmark and fly each weekend to Berlin, where the League of Legends matches are taped in front of a boisterous studio audience. In Copenhagen, they are required to get around by bicycle (a rule they all hated at first) and have fitness and yoga classes during the week. On Mondays, they meet with the team psychologist for an “empty-the-backpack” session.
Every morning, the team meets for breakfast in Broich’s apartment, a ritual designed in part to get the gamers — night owls and notoriously late risers — out of bed at a reasonable hour. Their other meals are catered with guidance from the nutritionist.
“Before, I would go to sleep at 5 a.m. and wake up at 2 p.m. the next day, eat McDonald’s two times, and that’d be it,” Patrik Jiru, 18, an Origen player from the Czech Republic, said as he ate a salmon and vegetable omelet one recent morning.
After breakfast, the players biked to the gym for a core workout and a physical therapy session.
“Last time we did this, my body was sore for three days,” Jonas Andersen, 24, an Origen player from Denmark known as Kold, said as he grabbed a medicine ball.
Mikkel Hjuler, a trainer who works with Danish Olympians, guided the team through some gaming-specific exercises. He had the players wrap their fists inside elastic bands and flex their fingers. He taught them a neck exercise favored by boxers.
The players were willing participants, but they admitted that their ambitions, from a physical standpoint, were modest.
“I’m O.K. with being chubby as long as I don’t pass out when I’m running — which, right now, I might,” Aguirre said.
The players continue to train several hours a day in front of computers, but even those sessions now borrow elements from traditional sports.
Before a recent scrimmage session at the Rfrsh headquarters, Broich distributed magnesium pills and protein bars. (He keeps vitamin D and krill oil in his arsenal, too.) Later, he blended a potpourri of nutritional supplements — moringa, matcha, maca, chlorella, açaí and a half-dozen others — into a thick protein shake.
In their meeting room, a quotation attributed to the N.B.A. coach Phil Jackson — “The strength of the team is each individual member” — was scribbled on a dry-erase board. After one practice game, the team laid out yoga mats and stretched on foam rollers.
Trevor Henry, 31, a broadcast commentator for Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, marveled at how quickly the game’s competitive landscape was professionalizing. He was happy, for instance, that some teams were reconsidering their use of gaming houses, a classic e-sports setup in which players live and train together under one roof.
“Go back just a few years: Professional players would play 10 to 11 hours every day and do takeout food every day,” Henry said. “Pizza boxes would stack up rooms. Laundry would never get done. I’ll be brutally honest: Teams didn’t wash the team shirts. They’d have the same team shirt that they’d wear 24 weeks in a year that has never seen detergent.”
This lifestyle — part monk, part fraternity brother — was not only accepted but also held up as the very reason the players were successful. But that wisdom is now being challenged, and in Europe the shift by League of Legends this year to a 10-team, franchise model (akin to American sports leagues) has encouraged organizations to make more long-term investments.
Last year, Fabien Devide, the chairman of Team Vitality, a French gaming organization, spent seven months embedded in his League of Legends team’s gaming house in Berlin. He was startled by what he saw.
“It was a madhouse,” Devide said, describing an atmosphere with an utter lack of boundaries between personal and professional life. “It can become a toxic environment very quick.”
Devide said Team Vitality planned to move its players into separate apartments later this year. Acknowledging the pioneering example of Rfrsh, he said he was formalizing plans to open a training center for his organization in Paris and hire a performance director, in the mold of Hvidt, to devise a program grounded in traditional sports ideas.
Teams now understand that championships are won and lost in the details. When Origen was assembling its squad last year, Hvidt asked potential signees to complete a personality test with hundreds of questions to make sure it was building an emotionally compatible group.
In December, the players convened for a preseason camp with one catch: no computers. Instead, the players spent several days completing trust exercises and discussing their dreams with Lars Robl, a sports psychologist who spent two decades in the Danish special forces — “the real Counter Strike,” he joked — and whose other clients include the Danish soccer club F.C. Midtjylland.
Robl’s job now is to help the gamers see themselves as elite athletes, just like the soccer players.
“They have the same DNA,” Robl said. “They’re just not aware of it yet.”

Miguel Andujar, the Yankees third baseman, listened to the gently phrased questions about his injured right shoulder and the possibility of having season-ending surgery. He acknowledged the cold truths about torn labra: They can’t heal on their own, and most players who suffer similar ruptures end up on the operating table.
Yes, Andujar said, he gets that. But as he spoke before the Yankees’ 3-1 loss to the Detroit Tigers on Tuesday, Andujar dismissed the worst-case scenario, vowing to beat the odds, avoid surgery and return to action within weeks.
If he does so, it would be a rare instance of good fortune for the Yankees, who now have eight players on the 10-day Injured List, including their ace (Luis Severino), circus strong man and home run leader (Giancarlo Stanton), and their front-line shortstop (Didi Gregorius). Andujar joined them after a headfirst dive into third base against the Orioles on Sunday.
After initially feeling a “weird” sensation in his shoulder, Andujar said, he remained in the game, and he still felt strong afterward and even into Monday. But a magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed a small labral tear, prompting the Yankees to shut Andujar down for at least two weeks. After that, he will begin a cautious program of physical therapy, which he and the team hope will preclude the need for surgery.
“I’m optimistic,” Andujar said. “My shoulder is strong. There’s a still a chance I can get through this and get back on the field.”
Aaron Boone was just as inclined to turn his gaze away from the possibility of an Andujar-less summer. Hard to blame him: The 24-year-old infielder finished second in the American League’s rookie of the year voting in 2018, leading all first-year players in hits (170) and breaking the Yankees’ record for doubles in a rookie season — previously set by Joe DiMaggio in 1936.
Although inconsistent on defense — he committed 15 errors last year — Andujar’s performance partly explained the Yankees’ decision to pass on pursuing Manny Machado in free agency this winter. After losing to the Red Sox in a division series, the Yankees were decidedly upbeat about Andujar and their roster in general entering 2019.
That optimism was based on three factors: that Aaron Judge, who missed seven weeks with a broken wrist last summer, would be healthy in 2019; that Stanton would be better acclimated to playing in the high-pressure New York market in his second year; and that catcher Gary Sanchez had nowhere to go but up after batting a disastrous .186 last season.
Bundled with the continued maturation of Andujar and his fellow rookie Gleyber Torres, the Yankees felt they could close the gap on Boston without spending much on new additions. Judge spoke for his teammates recently when he said, “From the first day in camp, I felt this was going to be a better team than last year.”
But five games in, it has been a harsh reality for the Yankees, who have yet to gain traction on the season despite starting off against two lightly regarded opponents, the Orioles and Tigers. An unusually severe run of injuries has only compounded their frustration.
Severino, who received a diagnosis of shoulder inflammation last month, still has not thrown off a mound, and he is not likely to return until May at the earliest. Center fielder Aaron Hicks is battling a stubborn lower back problem; he has already received two cortisone shots. Dellin Betances, the flame-throwing reliever, is sidelined with a shoulder impingement, although he threw a bullpen session on Tuesday and could be back in a week.
Stanton’s injury was the most mysterious: a grade-1 strain of his left biceps he sustained with what Boone called a “funky” swing on Sunday. Like Andujar, Stanton will be out of the lineup for at least 10 days, although his injury is less serious. Nevertheless, the Yankees have been forced to depend on reinforcements earlier than expected, putting their depth — and emotional resilience — to the test.
The always-upbeat Boone said he felt the Yankees would emerge as a better team after April’s challenges.
“One of the strengths of our organization is the depth,” he said, adding that each of the Yankees’ replacements were “capable of producing at the big league level.”
Boone’s rallying cry might have resonated a bit more had the Yankees not lost their opening series to the Orioles. Most damning was their situational hitting: The Yankees went 10 for 56 with runners on base in the three-game series, including 6 for 29 (.207) with men in scoring position, including eight strikeouts.
There wasn’t much improvement on Tuesday, when the Yankees managed just six hits against the Tigers and didn’t have a runner in scoring position over the final four innings.
Starter Masahiro Tanaka threw effectively for 6⅔ innings, but his work was undone by closer Aroldis Chapman, who continues to lose velocity.
As Chapman allowed the deciding two runs in the ninth inning, his once-feared 100-miles-per-hour fastball ticked down as low as 95.
“I feel great,” he said despite allowing four of the seven batters he faced to reach base, dooming the Yankees to another loss.
First baseman Luke Voit asked for patience from unsettled fans, saying: “It’s super early. There are still 157 games to go.”
But a different crew will have to right the ship.
Without Andujar and Stanton, call-ups like Clint Frazier and Tyler Wade will get their chance. D.J. LeMahieu, the infielder acquired by the Yankees in January, started in place of Andujar on Tuesday.
But will it be the same Yankees? Boone insisted that his “expectations have not changed,” although no one could blame him for crossing his fingers — tightly.

A rough start to the 2019 season got significantly worse for the Yankees on Monday. In a surprising announcement in the morning, the already-bruised Yankees placed their star outfielder Giancarlo Stanton on the injured list with a left biceps strain. Then, 30 minutes before the start of a 3-1 win over the Detroit Tigers on Monday night, the team announced that third baseman Miguel Andujar had joined the list with a right shoulder injury that might require a season-ending operation.
Stanton, a crucial power hitter, and Andujar, the American League rookie of the year runner-up last season, exhibited no obvious signs of injury during a season-opening series loss to the lowly Baltimore Orioles.
Andujar, 24, hurt his shoulder while sliding back into third base in the fourth inning of Sunday’s 7-5 loss to the Orioles. But he finished the game, reporting no problems. Scheduled to be off on Monday, he visited the trainer’s room to have the shoulder checked and then was sent for a magnetic resonance imaging exam, which revealed a torn labrum.
Yankees Manager Aaron Boone said the team would try therapy for Andujar and then re-evaluate his shoulder in a couple of weeks to see if surgery seemed necessary.
“His physical test with the doctor is really good, so there is some optimism that, treated conservatively, he can respond and come back and play,” Boone said. “But we’ll know that in a couple weeks.”
In his absence, the Yankees will lean on D.J. LeMahieu at third base, and they have called up the utility man Tyler Wade from Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.
The list of key Yankees who are either injured or still returning from injury now contains eight players: Stanton, Andujar, shortstop Didi Gregorius, outfielders Aaron Hicks and Jacoby Ellsbury, and pitchers Dellin Betances, C. C. Sabathia and Luis Severino. In that group, there are a combined 17 All-Star appearances, one Cy Young Award winner (Sabathia) and one most valuable player (Stanton).
“It’s unfortunate right now,” Stanton said before the game, “but I guess it’s better to be in the beginning than at the end of the year.”
Stanton, 29, played every inning of the Orioles series in left field and was 2 for 8 at the plate with four strikeouts and seven walks. He later revealed that he felt discomfort while swinging during a third-inning at-bat on the chilly Sunday evening.
He considered alerting Yankees coaches but instead chalked it up to a cramp. When the tightness in his arm persisted after the game and he started thinking it had affected the quickness of his swing, Stanton informed the team.
A magnetic resonance imaging examination revealed a Grade 1 strain — the mildest on a scale of three — so Stanton will be shut down for 10 days and, according to Boone, could return at any point this month.
“I don’t like it at all,” Stanton said. “Just worked for six weeks to get here, plus the off-season. I’d much rather this would’ve popped in spring training. But that’s where we’re at. I don’t have to start from scratch when I come back.”
”
Still, as the injuries have piled up during spring training and in the early days of the season, the Yankees’ depth has been getting a stiff early test.
“People asked me all spring how I like the team, and I tell people I love the team not just because of the guys we have in the room but the depth that we have,” outfielder Brett Gardner said. “Obviously we’re not expecting to get that depth tested this early on, but here we are April 1 and already making moves. Guys will just have to step up and get the job done.”
Against the Tigers, the remaining Yankees provided victory. Domingo German, a rotation fill-in, provided five stout innings while catcher Gary Sanchez and Gardner each homered.
Betances may be among the first of the injured Yankees to return this month, as Boone said he was progressing well after shoulder inflammation late in spring training. Sabathia, who is serving a five-game suspension stemming from an episode in which he threw at Tampa Bay’s Jesus Sucre in a game last fall, is also expected back this month. Once his suspension ends, Sabathia will move to the I.L. since he is a few weeks behind his fellow starting pitchers because of off-season operations on his heart and knee.
Severino is expected back from a shoulder injury in May, and Gregorius is expected to return from Tommy John surgery sometime during the summer. It is unclear when Ellsbury, who missed all of the 2018 season and was originally expected to be ready for spring training, could be ready for the major leagues since he is still recovering from hip surgery last year and a flare-up of a foot ailment.
Hicks’s nagging back injury has improved recently, but it required two cortisone shots. He has been out since March 1 and has not yet resumed baseball activities. “I don’t think it’s going to be deep into the season by any means, but he’s still got some weeks to go,” Boone said.
The Yankees once had six outfielders on the roster, but now three are on the I.L. Their outfield options now consist of Aaron Judge; Clint Frazier, who was also called up from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Monday; Michael Tauchman, who was acquired in a trade just before the season began; and Gardner.
Boone said Frazier would play frequently in Stanton’s absence. Frazier, once a top prospect who missed most of last season with a concussion, has hit .238 in limited opportunities in the major leagues over the past two years but made improvements to his swing this spring.

NEW YORK — The Alliance of American Football league is suspending operations before it can crown its first champions, but that is not stopping FanDuel's sportsbook from declaring a winner. 
FanDuel Group, a unit of Irish bookmaker Paddy Power Betfair PLC, on Wednesday said the Orlando Apollos should have been the AAF champs and that it would pay out all straight futures wagers as winners.
"For the fans that bet on the AAF, the least they should expect is for a competition to conclude as it should," FanDuel said in a statement. "We believe this is the very definition of a bad beat for sports fans everywhere."
The payouts apply to bets in New Jersey since FanDuel did not take any bets on the AAF in West Virginia or Pennsylvania, where it also operates sportsbooks.
This week, AAF owner Tom Dundon suspended operations after only eight weeks of game play following a number of operational and financial setbacks, according to media reports.
As the new legal U.S. sports betting market grows state by state, some operators have chosen to refund or pay out wagers where they think betters have gotten an especially bad break.
Such moves can serve to win over betters to legal, regulated bookmakers instead of the many pervasive illegal offshore websites.
In February, PointsBet refunded New Jerseyans' wagers after Duke University star player Zion Williamson's sneaker split open.
